# Activity Part A
Read Opara-Martins et al (2014) and Morrow et al (2021) and answer the following questions:

- What are some of the main vendor lock-in issues the authors identify? How would you mitigate them?
- What are some of the security concerns with the modern cloud? How can these be mitigated?

## Main vendor lock-in issues
The main vendor lock-in issue is the ability to migrate from one cloud service provider to another. Each provider develops their own specific solutions, API's and some even create their own programming language. The means that users become dependant on a particualr provider, or *Locked-in*.

Additionally, if a customer wanted to migrate their data to an almost identical product, provided by another provider, they would face prohibativly expensive migration costs.
