# Summative Assessment 1

## Project Brief
This assignment has two components, the team submission, and your individual peer assessment. All components must be submitted by end of unit 6. This assessment accounts for 20% of your final module mark. **Only one submission is required from each team with a limit of 2 pages (1000 words) for the report. All artefacts produced as part of this submission should be stored in your e-portfolio, due for submission in Unit 12.**  

#### Assignment Brief

Pampered pets are a bricks-and-mortar business, based in a leafy suburb of Hashington-on-the-Water. It employs 4 staff; Alice the owner/ manager; Cathy the shop manager; Andrea the store assistant and Harry the warehouse manager. 90% of their business is carried out face to face, with people coming into the store to buy items. A small percentage of clients will email their orders – once these are ready the staff email the clients who then travel to the store to pick up goods and pay. Recently Harry has started to use an old, networked computer (with a spreadsheet package) to keep track of warehouse deliveries and item locations. The front desk uses a computer for all sales and purchases so that transactions are recorded digitally – this makes VAT and Tax submissions easier. The main shop has a wireless gateway and hub that both computers are connected to. In addition, all the staff use the wireless connection for various apps on their smart phones.

The business is most famous for the quality of its pet foods – using the highest quality ingredients from local suppliers, with many items being prepared and packed in-house. This has a number of advantages including easy and regular quality checks of ingredients and a guaranteed supply chain – if necessary, employees could get into their cars and drive 10 minutes to the suppliers (mostly local farms) to pick up the ingredients by hand.

Cathy, cognisant of the influence and benefits of the Internet, has retained the services of a consultancy (your team) to research the best way to grow the business. The report should investigate all reasonable threats AND address the following three questions:

- Could an online presence grow the business by up to 50%?
- Could changing to an international supply chain reduce costs by up to 24%?
- Could the business lose up to 33% of its existing customers if the business doesn’t provide some online features?

Orla O’dour (eccentric Irish billionaire) decides to buy a share in the company and advises Cathy that the business should be digitalised to improve internal business processes and to expand the reach of the business internationally – and she is willing to fund the transformation.

#### Assessment Part 1: A Report by a Security and Risk Management team.

For this submission, your team are tasked with carrying out a risk assessment, evaluating the risks of both the effects of the digitalisation process and of the alternative of maintaining the status quo to the business. Which would you recommend, taking both assessments into account? Produce a risk identification report with your responses to these questions. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).

**Checklist:**

1. Carry out a risk assessment of the Pampered Pets business as it stands currently **(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)**. This should include:
    1. A selection of a risk assessment methodology with justifications for the selection.
    2. A risk and threat modelling exercise that enumerates and evaluates the current threats and risks to the business.
    3. A list of potential mitigations to the identified risks and threats.
2. Carry out a risk assessment around the potential digitalisation process as applied to the Pampered Pets business **(Application and Understanding weighted at 15%, Criticality weighted at 15%)**. This should include:
    1. A selection of a risk assessment methodology with justifications for the selection.
    2. A list of proposed changes that form the basis of the digitalisation process/ transformation (e.g., e-commerce portal, ERP system, online marketing, blogs, etc. – note you do not have to include ALL these features).
    3. A risk and threat modelling exercise that enumerates and evaluates the potential threats and risks to the business of the proposed changes.
    
    5. A list of potential mitigations to the identified risks and threats.
3. Finally, provide a summary of your recommendations for the business. Do you recommend that the digitalisation process be carried out? If so, what would be involved? **(Application and Understanding weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%)**.

**Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%)** includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.

It is recommended that most of these questions are addressed as bullet points to meet the word count requirement – the timeline can be expressed as a diagram or Gantt chart.

Please note that appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

#### Assessment Part 2: Peer Review

At the end of the week, you will also need to submit your peer assessment form, available in the Module Resources page. Please see guidelines on the [Department’s website](https://www.my-course.co.uk/course/view.php?id=4634&section=0) (Group/Teamwork). If you do not submit an assessment of your peers, your score will be determined by your tutor.

#### Learning Outcomes

- Identify and analyse critically security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems, accounting for the current threat landscape.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts & warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of risks & security issues.
