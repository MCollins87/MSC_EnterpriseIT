# The Great Debate - The Future of SRM

Each team will choose a trend that they think will be the most influential in the next 5 years and will prepare a 10-minute presentation on that trend that summaries the key points and argues why they believe it will be the most influential in the next 5 years. Each team will be given a slot in this week's seminar where they will be able to present their slides and their arguments. Following the presentations, all attendees will be given a chance to ask questions and discuss their own views. At the end of the discussion the tutor will run a poll and all attendees will be given the chance to vote for their favourite.
