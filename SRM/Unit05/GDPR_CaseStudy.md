# GDPR Case Study

## Brief
Read the website at [Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data Protection Commission](https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies)
There are several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. Chose a case study (should be unique to each student) and answer the following questions:

- What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?
- How was it resolved?
- If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?

## Chosen case:
**Case 5** from 2017: "Disclosure of sensitive personal data by a hospital to a third party"

**What Happened:** Due to a number of seemingly innocuous errors, a patients medical records were sent to the patients neighbour. 

The information commissioner ruled that the hospital had failed to keep personal data accurate, complete and up to date; failed to take appropriate security measures; and failed to meet the legal basis for processing sensitive personal data. 

The following GDPR principles were not maintained
- Accurate Data Storage
	- The address used to send the medical records was not correct.
- Integrity and Confidentiality Principle
	- Procedures were not in place to ensure only the required recipient received the medical records
- Accountability Principle
	- During the investigation, the Hospital were unable to explain fully how this error occurred, nor were that able to satisfy that Hospital was not the source of the breach.

Were I to be in a position to mitigate these issues, the additional measures I would take would be:
- Where possible, a digital transfer to the patients GP. The record can be linked to patients Electronic Medical Record (EMR) by unique identifiers (e.g. NHS number in UK).
	- Minimise the need to make a physical copy of the records. 
- If Postal service is required (e.g. patient GP is under a separate health authority), then
	- A windowed envelop must always bee used to endure transcription errors are eliminated
	- A "Private and Confidential" stamp should be used on the outside of the envelope with instructions to "return to sender", and a clear senders address. 
- At all patient contact, the practitioner should verify key information including name, DOB, address, next of kin, and address.
