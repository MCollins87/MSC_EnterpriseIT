# Security and Risk Management

## [Formative Asessment: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1](FA1)
### Brief
Based on your reading of the case study(Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) answer the following questions in the discussion forum:
- What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples.
- Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.
- Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.


## Module Reflections:
- Reading Spears & Barki (2010), they expand on user participation used in System Design to apply to risk management.
  - Involvong users in design of systems and security and the expected benefits, is how I have always viewed good and effective stakeholder management.
  - Keep your stakeholders involved and enagged, and they will have a sence of ownership of product, resulting in greater uptake and addoption of change.

- Unit 1 lecture cast introduced three control measures for risk management:
1. Physical Controls
2. Procedural Controls
3. Technical Controls
- This contrasts to my traditional view of two methods:
1. Procedural controls (what people do)
2. Engineering controls (Physical Barriers / fail-safe)
