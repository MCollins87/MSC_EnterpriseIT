For this submission, your team are tasked with carrying out a risk assessment, evaluating the risks of both the effects of the digitalisation process and of the alternative of maintaining the status quo to the business. Which would you recommend, taking both assessments into account? Produce a risk identification report with your responses to these questions.

### [Threat Modelling Exercise](ModellingExcercise)


## Module Reflections:
- Reading Spears & Barki (2010), they expand on user participation used in System Design to apply to risk management.
  - Involvong users in design of systems and security and the expected benefits, is how I have always viewed good and effective stakeholder management.
  - Keep your stakeholders involved and enagged, and they will have a sence of ownership of product, resulting in greater uptake and addoption of change.

- Unit 1 lecture cast introduced three control measures for risk management:
1. Physical Controls
2. Procedural Controls
3. Technical Controls
- This contrasts to my traditional view of two methods:
1. Procedural controls (what people do)
2. Engineering controls (Physical Barriers / fail-safe)
