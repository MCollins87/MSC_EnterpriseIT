1. A GMC dealer believes that demand for 2005 Envoys will be normally distributed with a mean of 200 and standard deviation of 30. His cost of receiving an Envoy is $25,000, and he sells an Envoy for $40,000. Half of all the Envoys not sold at full price can be sold for $30,000. He is considering ordering 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, or 300 Envoys. How many should he order?

2. A small supermarket is trying to determine how many copies of *People* magazine they should order each week. They believe their demand for *People* is governed by the following discrete random variable:

| Demand | Probability|
|---|---|
|15 | 0.10 |
|20|0.20|
|25|0.30|
|30|0.25|
|35|0.15|

The supermarket pays $1.00 for each copy of *People* and sells it for $1.95. Each unsold copy can be returned for $0.50. How many copies of *People* should the store order?
