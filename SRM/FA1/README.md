## Initial Post
In their discussion on the risks of digitalisation, Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) mention the concept of Industry 4.0, without providing a concrete definition. The ambiguity over the definition of Industry 4.0 opens a new area of research, discussing definitions (Culot et al., 2020). Industry 4.0 has numerous synonyms, such as “smart manufacturing”, “internet of things”, “digital transformation” and “fourth industrial revolution” (Culot et al., 2020).
Whilst these terms have been used to refer to Industry 4.0, they are not synonymous of each other. For example, digital transformation does not necessarily imply connectivity required for internet of things. 
Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) appear to be using a narrow definition of Industry 4.0 to mean Digital Transformation, or “Digitalisation”. To this end, they propose a novel risk assessment matrix to be used when assessing digital transformation (RADi). They also define six key types of risk a business is exposed to during digitalisation of an existing business model: 
-	Technical
-	Competence
-	Acceptance by staff
-	Acceptance by customers and partners
-	Data privacy and security 
-	Financial risks
  
Alternatively Yucel (2018) identifies the following types of risk:

-	Business case related
-	Business Challenges
-	Strategy related
-	Support and sponsorship related
-	Culture related
-	Technology related
-	Implementation related

Many of the risks identified within the types listed in Yucel (2018) can be re-categorised into the six defined by Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019). For example, Yucel (2018) identifies “*Lack of management understanding of the digital economy and digital disruption in the early development phase*” can be mapped to “*Acceptance by customers and partners*” identified by Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019). Likewise, Yucel (2018) identified  “*Skill set: Not having the right skillset during the transformation and/or for operations thereafter. Talent deficit is a risk as digital transformations require new talent, including software engineers, product managers, DevOps engineers, data scientists and artificial intelligence professionals*” as an implementation related risk, but is clearly a competence risk. 

While Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) provide a method of assessing risk related to digital transformation, their approach requires an expert assessment, which may not always be available to a small to medium enterprise (SME). The list of explicit risks identified in Yucel (2018) make a qualitative approach to assessing digital transformation risks more accessible to SME’s.
