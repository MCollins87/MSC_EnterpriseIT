In their paper Risk of Digitalisation of Business Models, Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) created a risk assessment matrix to assess potential risks, resulting from digitalisation of business models in the context of Industry 4.0, which they refer to as follows.

“The 4th industrial revolution moves from there and encompasses a range of technological drivers as the Internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence and explores the decentralisation of communication between people and machine.”

For their matrix, they identified the following 6 types of risk:

- Technical
- Competence
- Acceptance by staff
- Acceptance by customers
- Data security
- Financial risks 

In May 2023, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined Meta Platform Ireland Limited €1.2 billion for violating GDPR by transferring personal data from the EU/EEA to the US without adequate safeguards (Sharman & Hill, 2024).

General Electric's (GE) digital transformation project, Predix, failed despite significant investments due to overambitious goals, technical complexities, and organisational misalignment. The project aimed to build an industrial IoT platform but faced challenges integrating diverse data and lacked internal capabilities to sustain development. As a result, GE incurred $7 billion in costs, missed revenue targets, and fell behind competitors in the IoT market (Pereira, N.D.)

The second example emphathises that the complexity which digitalisation projects can contain, must not be underestimated. Kharlamova and Kharlamov (2019) elaborate about the importance of the development of human capital in digitalisation and conclude the following:

- Impact on Human Capital: Effective organization of work for personnel managing digital risks enhances employees' innovative and creative potential, leading to positive changes in their motivation and overall development of the company’s human capital, especially during the transition to digital business platforms.
- Managerial Action Framework: A seven-stage sequence of managerial actions for handling information related to digital risks has been proposed. This structured approach provides new benchmarks for the organizational behavior of risk management personnel and is shown to improve the company’s human capital when effectively implemented.

Hi Tobi
you make some excellent points - I would recommend you pursue your idea of human capital with points I've made elsewhere about humans in the loop. You made the point elsewhere (related to here) that not accounting for technical complexity is a management problem that can lead to major risks such as reputational damage and even the death of some staff. Therefore the responsibility of companies (And management) in these supposed technical processes cannot be over estimated.
Can you see how the Boeing example and the points you make here are inter-related?

Hi Doug, Hi Tobi, thank you for your excellent points. Please let me add a few more thoughts.

The Boeing example and the incidents involving Meta and General Electric (GE) are deeply interconnected, especially regarding the management of complex technical systems and the critical role of effective risk management. Boeing’s 737 Max disaster highlights the severe consequences of neglecting comprehensive risk assessment and testing of complex technologies. This mirrors the issues faced by GE's Predix platform. In both cases, the lack of adequate oversight and a failure to address technical risks resulted in significant financial and reputational damage, alongside, in Boeing's case, tragic loss of life (Browning, 2021).

The Meta incident further emphasizes the importance of adhering to regulatory and security standards. The oversight in data protection in Meta’s case is analogous to Boeing's failure in safety oversight. Both cases illustrate that when organizations prioritize innovation over compliance and risk management, the consequences can be severe. This highlights the necessity to embed robust risk management frameworks within a company’s organizational culture, ensuring that all aspects of technical, regulatory, and safety risks are addressed (Obermeyer et al., 2019).

Moreover, these examples illustrate the dangers of underestimating human factors in managing complex systems. Boeing's reliance on software to manage aircraft stability without adequate pilot training parallels the risks identified by Kharlamova and Kharlamov (2019), who stress the importance of developing human capital in digitalization projects. Both cases show that the human element cannot be sidelined, and effective training is crucial to manage complex technological systems.

In conclusion, these cases reveal a common thread: the failure to integrate comprehensive risk management, human factors, and regulatory compliance into the development of complex systems. Company’s must learn from these failures that innovation does not come at the expense of safety, compliance, and human lives.

Hi Tobi, Doug, and Gesine,

Some very interesting and insightful points have been raised.

It would appear that Human Factors is something that is often overlooked in Digital transformations and the move to Industry 4.0, as highlighted in Neumann et al. (2021).
 
Considering Human Factors during digital transformation, and following the framework outlined in Neumann et al. (2021), an organisation can attempt to mitigate the majority of categories highlighted by Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019), in particular Competence, Acceptance by Staff and Acceptance by Customers, but also, as demonstrated by Spears & Barki (2010), Data Security can also be improved by considering the Human aspect of security.

To reduce the Human-based risks of Industry 4.0, the logical progression is to consider the Human-centric approach of Industry 5.0 (Golovianko et al., 2022).

Finally, what is also clear from your examples, is that failing to safeguard effectively against the first five types of risk, is in itself a significant Financial risk, whether it be financial penalties for failing to secure data (Sharma & Hill, 2024), or failing to understand the market, and mitigate other types of risk (Pereira, n.d.).
