# User Participation in Risk Management

## Brief
Read the Spears & Barki (2010) article then prepare answers to the following questions:

* How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?
* What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?
* Based on the findings of the research,
  * How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?
  * Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?
  * How might you mitigate any issues encountered?

You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and is a component of the e-portfolio, which you can submit at the end of the module.

## Activity
- Spears, J., & Barki, H. (2010) User Participation in Information Systems Security Risk Management. *MIS Quarterly* 34(3): 503-522

Spears & Barki (2010) examined user participation in risk management of information systems. They also looked at **Qualitative** and **Quantitative** methods of risk assessments. 

Key findings were:
- **Qualitative** method allows a process model to be constructed, using user participation.
- A **Quantitative** method can then be applied to this **Qualitative** process.
- **Qualitative** methods can involve the end user, allowing improved buy-in.
- **Qualitative** methods also allow for a deeper understanding of the risk.
- A **Quantitative** apporach can be used to test a thoretical model based on **Qualitative** approach.
- Both approaches of **Quantitative** and **Qualtitative** risk assessments have their benefits
  - If communicating to end users, the deeper understanding of **Qualitative** risks allow for improved end user mitigation
  - If communicating to higher level management **Quantitative** risks allow for quick understanding of the impact to the organisation without needing to understand the risk in detail.
- Limiting to just one approach means risks can be missed. For example, if following a **Quantitative** approach, data is required, meaning **Qualitative** risks based on users tacit knowledge could be missed completely.
