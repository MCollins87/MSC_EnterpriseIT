# User Participation in Risk Management

- Spears, J., & Barki, H. (2010) User Participation in Information Systems Security Risk Management. *MIS Quarterly* 34(3): 503-522

Spears & Barki (2010) examined user participation in risk management of information systems. They also looked at **Qualitative** and **Quantitative** methods of risk assessments. 

Key findings were:
- **Qualitative** method allows a process model to be constructed, using user participation.
- A **Quantitative** method can then be applied to this **Qualitative** process.
- **Qualitative** methods can involve the end user, allowing improved buy-in.
- **Qualitative** methods also allow for a deeper understanding of the risk.
- A **Quantitative** apporach can be used to test a thoretical model based on **Qualitative** approach.
- Both approaches of **Quantitative** and **Qualtitative** risk assessments have their benefits
  - If communicating to end users, the deeper understanding of **Qualitative** risks allow for improved end user mitigation
  - If communicating to higher level management **Quantitative** risks allow for quick understanding of the impact to the organisation without needing to understand the risk in detail.
- Limiting to just one approach means risks can be missed. For example, if following a **Quantitative** approach, data is required, meaning **Qualitative** risks based on users tacit knowledge could be missed completely.
