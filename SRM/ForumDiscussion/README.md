# Collaborative Learning Discussion 1
## Brief:
This discussion will last for 3 weeks covering units 1, 2 and 3. Ensure you include appropriate citations and references in all your posts (this is not included in the word count for each week's post/submission).

### Discussion Topic
Based on your reading of the case study(Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) answer the following questions in the discussion forum:

- What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples.
- Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.
- Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.
- 
### Instructions
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and is a component of the e-portfolio, which you will submit at the end of the module.

### Discussion Guidance
- Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as **'Initial Post'**
- You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in unit 2 (each labelled as **'Peer Response'**).  To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to **200-300 words maximum**, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. 
- In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as **‘Summary Post’**. It should be **300 words**.
- Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.
- You will be not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.
- This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you will submit in unit 12. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.
