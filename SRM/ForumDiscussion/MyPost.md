# Initial Post
In their discussion on the risks of digitalisation, Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) mention the concept of Industry 4.0, without providing a concrete definition. The ambiguity over the definition of Industry 4.0 opens a new area of research, discussing definitions (Culot et al., 2020). Industry 4.0 has numerous synonyms, such as “smart manufacturing”, “internet of things”, “digital transformation” and “fourth industrial revolution” (Culot et al., 2020).
Whilst these terms have been used to refer to Industry 4.0, they are not synonymous of each other. For example, digital transformation does not necessarily imply connectivity required for internet of things. 
Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) appear to be using a narrow definition of Industry 4.0 to mean Digital Transformation, or “Digitalisation”. To this end, they propose a novel risk assessment matrix to be used when assessing digital transformation (RADi). They also define six key types of risk a business is exposed to during digitalisation of an existing business model: 
-	Technical
-	Competence
-	Acceptance by staff
-	Acceptance by customers and partners
-	Data privacy and security 
-	Financial risks
  
Alternatively Yucel (2018) identifies the following types of risk:

-	Business case related
-	Business Challenges
-	Strategy related
-	Support and sponsorship related
-	Culture related
-	Technology related
-	Implementation related

Many of the risks identified within the types listed in Yucel (2018) can be re-categorised into the six defined by Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019). For example, Yucel (2018) identifies “*Lack of management understanding of the digital economy and digital disruption in the early development phase*” can be mapped to “*Acceptance by customers and partners*” identified by Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019). Likewise, Yucel (2018) identified  “*Skill set: Not having the right skillset during the transformation and/or for operations thereafter. Talent deficit is a risk as digital transformations require new talent, including software engineers, product managers, DevOps engineers, data scientists and artificial intelligence professionals*” as an implementation related risk, but is clearly a competence risk. 

While Kovaitė & Stankevičienė (2019) provide a method of assessing risk related to digital transformation, their approach requires an expert assessment, which may not always be available to a small to medium enterprise (SME). The list of explicit risks identified in Yucel (2018) make a qualitative approach to assessing digital transformation risks more accessible to SME’s.

Thank you, Mark, for this post that highlighted several important points.

As you mentioned on the deficit of skills necessary for digital transformation, the lack of specialized skills is a major challenge for companies adopting Industry 4.0. Companies need to invest in training and recruitment to bridge these gaps. Studies indicate that without proper investment in upskilling and reskilling the workforce, businesses will struggle to keep pace with technological advancements. This includes not only technical skills but also soft skills such as adaptability and problem-solving (Müller, Buliga, and Voigt, 2018).

Educating and training partners and clients can mitigate the lack of understanding of the digital economy among management. Moreover, effective communication strategies and demonstrations of the benefits of digital technologies can improve acceptance. For example, companies like Siemens have used live demonstrations and training to facilitate the acceptance of new technologies by their partners. This approach not only builds trust but also ensures that all stakeholders are aligned with the digital transformation strategy (Kiel, Arnold, and Voigt, 2017).

However, while educating and training are crucial, the process can be resource-intensive and may not yield immediate results. It's essential for companies to have a long-term strategy in place that includes continuous learning and development programs. Moreover, fostering a culture of innovation and flexibility within the organization can further support the successful adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies.

Thank you Mark and Stephanie for two excellent posts.
Mark - I particularly liked your comparison of the two papers - and the authors' approaches, and especially the point about qualitative risk assessment. Do you think a quantitive approach would have any value in these situations?
Stephanie - you make excellent points about training and upskilling. Do you think industry 4.0 focuses too much on the technical aspects to the detriment of the people side? Would the (emerging) Industry 5.0 as discussed by Jeroen Kraaijenbrink of Forbes be a better model?

Thank you for this informative and well-written initial post.

One key aspect of RADI is the heightened cybersecurity threat landscape. The increased connectivity and integration of smart technologies in Industry 4.0 can expose SMBs to a higher risk of cyber attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to critical systems (Carcary et al., 2016). Given the limited resources and expertise often available to SMBs, developing and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures can be a significant challenge.

Additionally, the complexity and interdependence of digital systems in Industry 4.0 can increase the risk of system failures, software glitches, and unexpected downtime, which can severely disrupt business operations and supply chain continuity (Ibarra et al., 2018). Ensuring the resilience and reliability of digital infrastructure is crucial for SMBs to maintain their competitiveness and meet customer expectations.

Furthermore, the extensive collection and utilization of data in Industry 4.0 can raise concerns about data privacy, ownership, and compliance with regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws (Issa et al., 2018). SMBs may struggle to effectively manage and secure the large volumes of data generated by their digital systems, potentially exposing them to legal and reputational risks.

To address these RADI, SMBs must develop comprehensive digital risk management strategies, invest in cybersecurity measures, ensure system resilience, and maintain the flexibility to adapt to technological advancements (Khin & Ho, 2019).

# Summary Post
Hi Stephanie, Doug and Samer,

Thankyou for your responses.

It would appear that from this thread, and others that I have been involved in, that major risks to Industry 4.0 are the human element. As Doug mentioned, perhaps Industry 5.0 has some of the answers (Kraaijenbrink, 2022). However, it is my opinion that the use of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 as the fourth and fifth industrial revolution is not appropriate, as I believe these can only be credited as revolutions once they are over and the impact is known. Instead, they should be seen as what they are – Policy.

I have spent the majority of my career working in the boundary of two levels of the Hierarchy of Controls (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2024), that of Administrative and Engineering. The goal of using the Hierarchy is to move control measures to the safer level, in this case, from Administrative to Engineering.

Training requirements could in theory be mitigated by the engineering control of the introduction of improved and more intuitive interfaces, leaving administrative controls to stakeholder management.

One might assume that moving to Industry 4.0 is an introduction of Engineering controls, but as Samer has pointed out, the complexity and interdependence of digital systems in Industry 4.0 can leave an organisation open to additional risk, particularly if there is an over reliance (Kleinman, 2024). Things do go wrong, and engineering controls are, by definition, designed to put a system into a “fail-safe” state. However “failing safe” minimises physical harm, however if this requires airlines to ground plains, or for an MRI scanner to be quenched of cooling, there are significant knock-on effects.

The human factor can never be eliminated and must be considered at every stage of design and implementation, and a wholistic approach proposed by Industry 5.0 attempts to do just that(Kraaijenbrink, 2022).
