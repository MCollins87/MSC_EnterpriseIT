### 1. Review of report

- All reviewed the report. 
- AI editing tools used to re-phase some longer paragraphs to reduce wordcount to below 1100 upper limit. 
- Agreed that methodology for risk assessments should be included in appendix. It is broad enough to apply to more than the context of the report. 
- SI to provide details of some of the references MC could not find. 
- Attack tree added to appendix. 

### 2. Submission

- Assuming nothing is mentioned in the seminar on Wednesday, all members to review final version by Thursday/Friday, ready for submission over the weekend.
