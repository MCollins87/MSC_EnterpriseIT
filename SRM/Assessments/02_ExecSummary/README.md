## Assignment Brief
Cathy has decided to start the digitalisation process. In addition to the changes you recommended, she has decided to add an international supply chain and a number of automated warehouses worldwide. The changes immediately attract the attention of two very high-profile new customers – HRH the King and Prince Albert 2nd of Monaco. However, both are concerned about the effect of these digitalisation changes on the world-famous quality of the products and the security of the supply chain.

Produce an Executive Summary which provides an estimate of the probabilities that changes to the operations of the business and the supply chain could endanger both the quality and availability of the company's products. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid located in Module Resources.

### Executive Summary
**Checklist:**

1. Enumerate the potential risks to the quality and supply chain for the company **(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Use of relevant sources weighted at 10%)**. This should include:
    a. The selection of quantitative risk modelling approach(es) with justification for the method chosen.
    b. Explanation of the calculations carried out, including detailed lists of assumptions and sources of data selected (where appropriate).
    c. Results of the quantitative models used.

2. Based on the quantitative modelling above, produce a summary of the results along with your recommendations around the potential risk of loss of quality (with the probability of it occurring); the potential risk of supply chain issues including a list of potential issues with associated probability of them occurring. See the reading for specific chapters of your core ebook that provide data and guidance on the techniques used above. **(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 20%, Use of relevant sources weighted at 5%)**.

3. Ms O’dour has also recommended that if the business is to be digitalised, there should also be put into place a business continuity/ disaster recovery (DR) strategy that will ensure that the business’ online presence could continue in the event of a disaster affecting the shop premises. The online shop needs to be available 24/7/365 with a less than 1 minute changeover window should DR need to be invoked. She has also recommended that the business cannot afford to lose more than 1 minute of data. Your team are tasked with the job of designing a DR solution that meets Ms. O’dour’s requirements. She also wants you to recommend the platform that should be chosen to host the solution and to provide advice on vendor lock-in. **(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%, Use of relevant sources weighted at 5%)**.

**Presentation and Structure of your findings (weighted at 10%)** includes spelling, organisation, as well as evidence of proofreading. You will also be assessed on the correct use (and format) of citations and references in your work **(Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)**.

Note that the executive summary should organise any recommendations in order of the priority to the business’ commercial needs. The organisation is particularly interested in how well they meet current security standards (including the new GDPR directive) and expect to see any mitigations required to meet such standards clearly called out as important business requirements.

Please also note that appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information (for example, to provide details of calculations). One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

### Learning Outcomes
Critically determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to mitigate and/or solve security risks and their business impact.
Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals.
