# Assignment 2 Brief

Submit by end of unit 6. Monday 2nd December 2024

This is the second summative assignment and is worth 60% of the overall module grade.

The word count is 1,500 words. This is a programming exercise.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, students will build upon the [CMDB design developed in a previous phase](./../Assignment1/CMDBDesign.md) and proceed to implement the designed CMDB prototype. They will populate the CMDB with real or simulated data, ensuring that it accurately represents the configuration items (CIs) and relationships identified in the design phase. Additionally, students will prepare a demonstration to showcase the functionality and usability of the implemented CMDB for ITSM tasks.

This summative assignment is designed to assess students' ability to implement and demonstrate a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) tailored for IT Service Management (ITSM) purposes. Students will be required to translate a detailed CMDB design into a functional implementation and showcase its usability and effectiveness in managing IT service.

## Assessment Instructions

This assignment is comprised of two phases.

### Phase 1: CMDB Implementation Phase

- Utilize appropriate tools and technologies (such as ServiceNow CMDB/BMC Helix CMDB/iTop/GLPI/Device42/Open-AudIT, etc), to implement the designed CMDB prototype, adhering to the specifications outlined in the CMDB design document.
- Implement the data schema, including tables, fields, and relationships, as defined in the CMDB design.
- Populate the CMDB with sample data representing IT service configurations, assets, dependencies, and relationships.
- Ensure that the implemented CMDB can support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for configuration data and that data integrity and consistency are maintained.

### Phase 2: CMDB Demonstration Phase

- Prepare a demonstration of the implemented CMDB prototype, showcasing its features, functionalities, and usability for ITSM tasks.
- The demonstration should cover key scenarios such as:
    - Adding, updating, and deleting configuration items.
    - Viewing configuration item details and relationships.
    - Performing impact analysis and change management.
    - Generating reports and visualisations based on CMDB data.
- Present the demonstration highlighting the CMDB's effectiveness in supporting ITSM processes and workflows.

## Submission Requirements

- Source code and documentation for the implemented CMDB prototype.
- A demonstration video (5-7 minutes) illustrating the functionality and usability of the CMDB for ITSM tasks.
- Any additional supporting materials or artifacts relevant to the assignment.

## Assessment Criteria

- Quality and completeness of the implemented CMDB prototype.
- Accuracy and relevance of configuration data stored in the CMDB.
- Effectiveness of the demonstration in showcasing the CMDB's functionality and usability for IT security management.
- Alignment with CMDB design specifications and ITSM requirements.
- Critical analysis of implementation challenges and potential improvements.

## Student Advice

- Ensure that the implemented CMDB prototype aligns with the CMDB design developed in the previous phase.
- Seek clarification from the instructor regarding assignment requirements and expectations.
- Allocate sufficient time for implementation and demonstration phases to ensure successful completion of the assignment.

## Learning Outcomes

- Identify and critically analyse IT service challenges and processes in business systems, accounting for the current enterprise landscape.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet resources and business publications) to aid in the systematic analysis of IT service issues.
- Critically evaluate appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques to mitigate and/or solve IT service issues and their business impact.
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by ITSM professionals.
