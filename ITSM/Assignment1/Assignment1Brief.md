# Assignment 1 Brief
Submit by end of unit 3. Monday 11th November 2024.

This is the first summative assignment for this module and is worth 40% of the overall module grade.

Word count is 1,000 words. This is a technical report.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, students will be tasked with designing a CMDB specifically tailored to support IT security management functions within an organisation. They will develop a detailed CMDB design, focusing on capturing and managing configuration data related to security assets, vulnerabilities, compliance requirements, and access controls. Additionally, students will demonstrate a prototype of the designed CMDB and its functionality in a presentation format.

This summative assignment aims to assess students' ability to design and demonstrate a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) tailored for IT Security Management purposes. Students are expected to create a comprehensive CMDB design and present a functional demonstration showcasing its usability and effectiveness in managing IT security assets and configurations.

## Assessment Instructions
### CMDB Design Phase

- Conduct a thorough analysis of IT security management requirements, including asset management, vulnerability tracking, compliance monitoring, and incident response.
- Based on the analysis, design a conceptual data model for the CMDB, identifying key configuration items (CIs), attributes, and relationships pertinent to IT security management.
- Develop a detailed CMDB design document outlining the architecture, data schema, data validation rules, and user interface specifications.

### CMDB Demonstration Phase

- Prepare a demonstration of the CMDB prototype, showcasing its features, functionalities, and usability for IT security management tasks.
- The demonstration should cover scenarios such as adding new security assets to the CMDB, updating configuration data, conducting vulnerability assessments, and generating compliance reports.
- Present the demonstration to the module tutor, explaining the rationale behind design decisions, implementation challenges, and potential enhancements.

## Submission Requirements

- A comprehensive CMDB design document detailing the architecture, data model, and user interface design.
- Any additional supporting materials or artifacts relevant to the assignment.

## Assignment Criteria

- Clarity and coherence of the CMDB design document.
- Accuracy and relevance of configuration data stored in the CMDB.
- Critical analysis of design decisions and potential improvements.
- Overall presentation and professionalism in the submission.

## Student Advice

- Seek clarification from the module tutor regarding assignment requirements and expectations
- Ensure all work is original and properly cited if referencing external sources
- Allocate sufficient time for the design phases to ensure successful completion of the assignment.

## Learning Outcomes

- Identify and critically analyse IT service challenges and processes in business systems, accounting for the current enterprise landscape.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet resources and business.
- Critically evaluate appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques to mitigate and/or solve IT service issues and their business impact.
