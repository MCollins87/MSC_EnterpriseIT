Read the Road Traffic statistics in the London region report below.

    Department of Transport. (2023) [Road traffic statistics: London.](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6)

Critically evaluate the Road Traffic statistics and design an enterprise data analysis strategy for deploying an EDA model for managing the data of road traffic in the London region.

This report should evaluate Datawarehouse, lakes, cloud and analytics tools and the role these play in the development of Business Intelligence Systems. The report should provide a rationale for your design choice (i.e., which tables to choose and/or concatenate, and why)

Your report (1500 words) should contain the following aspects:

- Use of an EDA model or framework for designing your strategy.
- Use of data representation strategies (i.e., what type of EDA Model adopted and why).
- A description of Road Traffic statistics, focusing primarily on congestion and current issues. This section should reflect your knowledge and understanding on the Road Traffic System (15% weight).
- An overview of your selected data architecture and models. This section should reflect your knowledge and understanding on the dataset (25% weight).
- A critical discussion on data analysis design choice and methodology (30% weight).
- A critical discussion on data representation choices (10% weight).
- Detailed discussion on the strengths and limitations of different choices (20% weight).

## Learning Outcomes

- Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying, and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets.
- Understand the application and management of enterprise-based systems through digitalisation.
- Optimise the use of limited resources to enable Businesses stay competitive and efficient.
