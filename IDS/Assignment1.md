# Collaborative Discussion

## Brief

Discuss your views on the topic using the articles below:

Hero, A., Kar, S., Moura, J., Neil, J., Poor, H. V., Turcotte, M. & Xi, B. (2023) Statistics and Data Science for Cybersecurity. _Harvard Data Science Review 5(1)_.

Tebout, B. (2021) The challenges of the convergence of Data, AI, Cloud, Blockchain, IoT and Cybersecurity. _European Scientist_.

There is a paradigm shift towards the convergence of data science, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity. Data would be the primary nucleus and engine for this evolution and paradigm shift. Using published sources discuss the implications of this evolution and paradigm shift, emerging trend, and school of thought by analysing and evaluating the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of such a future development. Your analysis and evaluation should include:

    The emergence of data science as a subject area.
    Data as the main driver and engine for data science, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity.
    Highlight the opportunities, limitations, and challenges.

You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, et cetera). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth.
