  abstract = {Joint actions with other businesses are key to the survival of many companies today. Advanced collaboration technologies support companies in synchronizing their joint actions by forming digital business ecosystems (DBE). While such technologies are beneficial to companies, their use might also be potentially detrimental due to the increased complexity they add to the management of the BDE partners' collaboration and due to the partners' lack of knowledge in coping with this complexity. For companies to deal with the complexities in their dynamic environments, they need approaches for mapping out and analyzing their DBEs. Due to the newness of the DBE concept, how to model and analyze DBEs is hardly known. Yet, this is necessary, as partners in a DBEs want to know if their DBEs promotes or prohibits profit. This article proposes an approach to modelling and analyzing DBEs, based on the complimentary use of ArchiMate standards and quantitative methods such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process and linear programming. We carried out a first evaluation of the proposed approach by using an expert panel of practitioners. Our results indicate that the approach is easy to use from practitioner's perspective and that it can assist practitioners in executing their modelling and analysis tasks. However, more empirical evaluation research is needed in order to improve the approach's applicability in supporting companies in making DBE-related decisions.},

  abstract = {Enterprises today aspire to optimize the operating costs and carbon footprint (CFP) of their IT operations jointly without compromising their business imperatives. This has given rise to a hybrid approach in which enterprises retain the dynamic choice to leverage private data centers and one or more public clouds in conjunction. While cloud service providers (CSPs) have long provided APIs for estimating, reconciling, and optimizing operating costs, they have only recently started exposing APIs related to CFP.Indeed, this is a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, our analyses of these APIs reveals many gaps that need to be addressed to facilitate sizing and placement decisions that can factor in carbon. First, there is a lack of standardized, transparent methodology for CFP quantification across different CSPs. Second, the coarse granularity of the CFP data provided today can help with post-facto reporting but is not suitable for proactive fine-grained optimization. Last, enterprises themselves are unable to independently compute the current CFP or estimate potential CFP savings since CSPs do not share the required power usage data.To address these gaps, enterprises have started developing their own carbon assessment methodologies and tools to estimate the CFP of workloads running on public clouds using the available user-facing APIs. These systems hold the promise for an independent and unbiased evaluation and estimation of relative savings between different deployment options by cloud users. We describe and analyze the details of CSP-native carbon-reporting tools and their quantification methodology, and the "outside-of-the-cloud" estimation approaches. Finally, we present opportunities for future research in the direction of trustworthy, fine-grained, public cloud workload CFP estimation, which is a prerequisite for meaningful realization of carbon optimization.},

It is possible to accomplish this transformation with the help of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which defines infrastructure through code rather than through human setups. Using a logdriven experimental technique, this paper gives a comparative evaluation of two leading Integrated Containerization (IaC) solutions, namely Terraform and Amazon Web Services CloudFormation. Both tools were used to provision identical Amazon Web Services environments, and a total of 110 controlled deployment iterations were carried out for both of them under circumstances that were consistent. Key performance indicators, such as the percentage of successful deployments, the amount of time it takes to provision, and the number of times errors occur, were gathered from the logs that were generated by the system. According to the findings, both tools have a high degree of dependability, as evidenced by the fact that the overall deployment success rate is 94.55\% and the bulk of deployments (80\%) are completed within ten minutes. There were very few instances of failures occurring, with 87.27 percent of deployments operating without any faults. In addition to highlighting the operational efficiency and stability of both Terraform and CloudFormation, these findings also provide empirical insights that can assist cloud architects in picking the installation and configuration tool that is the most appropriate for their particular deployment requirements.},

Present paper addresses this challenge in an attempt to provide the needed understanding on the key drivers of AR experience and how these might enhance the consumer purchase experience itself. After trying a product via virtual try-on, participants in the current study had to provide evaluation in terms of both AR and purchase experience. The results are clear in showing that interactivity, realism, ease of use and immersion modulate AR experience evaluation and thus, the user satisfaction. Purchase experience correlated with utilitarian and hedonic values, predetermined by aesthetic and information quality. Utilitarian and hedonic values also affected the product knowledge. These relationships were well pronounced for participants reporting high satisfaction with the experience. Current outcomes are discussed further in a single framework combining various factors to provide the much-needed understanding on AR environments and their effect on consumer experience evaluation. Results could find a direct application in practices to design AR environments to augment consumer satisfaction and thus, enhancing the purchase journey.},

Cloud has working models with service-oriented delivery mechanism as well as deployment-oriented infrastructure mechanism. Data centers are the backbone of cloud computing. The massive participation of public has also increased the load on the cloud servers. Proper scheduling of resources is always needed. Quality of service is to be provided as per the service level agreement. Virtualization technique is the main reason behind the huge success of cloud. Multi-cloud exchanges to optimize connectivity today, multi-cloud exchanges offer the next level in direct connectivity, allowing organizations to safely and easily expand multi-cloud capabilities. Exchanges eliminate the added worries that an open Internet can bring as well as the tedious provisioning and configuring that comes with connecting to the public Internet. Importantly, multi-cloud exchanges allow organizations to establish a single connection to multiple cloud providers at the same time through an Ethernet switching platform, rather than wrestling with multiple individual connections to cloud providers.},

With the emergence of the public cloud's vast usage, administrators must be able to have a reliable method to provide the seamless experience that a public cloud offers on a smaller scale, such as a private cloud. When a smaller deployment or a private cloud is needed, OpenStack can meet the goals without increasing cost or sacrificing data control.To demonstrate these enablement goals of resiliency and elasticity in IaaS and PaaS, the authors design a private distributed system cloud platform using OpenStack and its core services of Nova, Swift, Cinder, Neutron, Keystone, Horizon and Glance on a five-node deployment.Through the demonstration of dynamically adding an IaaS node, pushing the deployment to its physical and logical limits, and eventually crashing the deployment, this paper shows how the PackStack utility facilitates the provisioning of an elastic and resilient OpenStack-based IaaS platform that can be used in production if the deployment is kept within designated boundaries.The authors adopt the multinode-capable PackStack utility in favor of an all-in-one OpenStack build for a true demonstration of resiliency, elasticity and scalability in a small-scale IaaS. An all-in-one deployment is generally used for proof-of-concept deployments and is not easily scaled in production across multiple nodes. The authors demonstrate that combining PackStack with the multi-node design is suitable for smaller-scale production IaaS and PaaS deployments.},

This study introduces a system structure that integrates Kubernetes management platforms with backup and restoration tools. This system is designed to immediately detect disasters and automatically recover applications from another Kubernetes cluster. The experimental results show that this system executes the restoration process within 15 s without human intervention, enabling rapid recovery. This, in turn, significantly reduces the potential for delays and errors compared to manual recovery processes, thereby enhancing data management and recovery efficiency in cloud environments. Moreover, our research model predicts the CPU utilization of the cluster using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The necessity of scheduling through this predict is made clearer through comparison with experiments without scheduling, demonstrating its ability to prevent performance degradation. This research highlights the efficiency and necessity of automatic recovery systems in cloud environments, setting a new direction for future research.},

This strategy involves the utilization of predictive analytics and machine literacy algorithms. When it comes to the ever-changing landscape of online retail, efficient force operation is necessary to satisfy customer demand while simultaneously minimizing the costs that are connected with overstocking and stockouts. To predict future demand for specific products, prophetic analytics methods are utilized, which involve the utilization of literal deal data in addition to other relevant elements. To create accurate prophetic models that are capable of locating complicated patterns and trends in the data, machine literacy methods such as arbitrary timbers, support vector machines, and neural networks are utilized. Through the incorporation of these prophetic models into the process of force operation, ecommerce businesses canoptimize force circumstances, expedite operations, and improve customer happiness. In addition to making a contribution to the expanding body of literature on data-driven approaches to force operation, this investigation demonstrates the potential for predictive analytics and machine literacy to be utilized in the process of tackling the specific issues that are associated with ecommerce.},

However, the scripting process does not automatically prevent practitioners from introducing misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or privacy risks. As a result, ensuring security relies on practitioners' understanding and the adoption of explicit policies. To understand how practitioners deal with this problem, we perform an empirical study analyzing the adoption of scripted security best practices present in Terraform files, applied on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. We assess the adoption of these practices by analyzing a sample of 812 open-source GitHub projects. We scan each project's configuration files, looking for policy implementation through static analysis (Checkov and Tfsec). The category Access policy emerges as the most widely adopted in all providers, while Encryption at rest presents the most neglected policies. Regarding the cloud providers, we observe that AWS and Azure present similar behavior regarding attended and neglected policies. Finally, we provide guidelines for cloud practitioners to limit infrastructure vulnerability and discuss further aspects associated with policies that have yet to be extensively embraced within the industry.},
