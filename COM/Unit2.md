# Unit 2 Formative Activity

## Formative Discussion: ROCCA and TOGAF

### Brief
Review the Anggraini N., Binariswanto and Legowo, N. 2019 article and post a discussion about ROCCA and ToGAF implementation in Government Agencies.

### Post
In their study, Anggraini, Binariswanto and Legowo (2019) analyse the use of the Roadmap for Cloud Computing Adoption (ROCCA) model, and The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) when implementing Cloud Infrastructure within a government agency. 

The benefits of TOGAF are highlighted, in terms of the robust, step-by-step approach, and production of multiple artefacts being beneficial to a public body. However, when compared to the targeted Cloud Specific ROCCA, TOGAF while supports the planning and preparation of cloud solutions, it lacks in the adoption, migration and management phase of cloud products. By developing a hybrid approach, the authors have leveraged the benefits of both TOGAF, and ROCCA. 

The case study presented, while attempting to remain open enough to be adopted by any public body, is focused on Indonesian legislation and the Oil and Gas industry. It is not clear if this approach would be the most beneficial in other sectors, such as healthcare, or in other jurisdictions such as UK, EU, USA, etc. 

Personally, the motivation for adopting cloud services resonates. My organisation is also struggling with the associated infrastructure for data centre expansion, such as space and power consumption. We have also undergone significant restructuring of Corporate services, which includes the IT department, resulting in increased staff turnover. I can see how using the Analysis and Planning phase of ROCCA will help convince key stakeholders in adopting a cloud strategy, particularly combined with the robust and well respected TOGAF.
