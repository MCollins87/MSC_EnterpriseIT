# Unit 1 Formative Activity

## Formative Discussion: AWS vs Google Cloud

### Brief
Compare and contrast the service models of two major cloud providers (e.g., AWS vs. Google Cloud). Discuss their differences in terms of flexibility, pricing, and specific use cases.

### Post
Cloud computing is growing in popularity, mainly due to the benefits offered, such as easy expansion, "pay as you use" models and the ability to set-up computing modules without infrastructure investment, whether that be Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS) (Kaushik et al., 2021).

According to the latest Gartner(R) Magic Quadrant, the grouping of the three main market leaders have become closer, with IBM recently entering the _Leader_ quadrant (Khan, 2024). 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) have consistently been one of the market leaders, with 32% of the market share, with Microsoft Azure coming second at 23% and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) holding only 10% of the cloud computing market (Borra, 2024). 

Google have been slow to offer the wide range of services the other two have, combined with the slow performance and higher costs as reported by Kaushik et al. (2021) accounts for the lower market share. 

AWS have been in the market for longer, and as such have a wider range of services than Microsoft, however Azure integrates with existing Microsoft services, and may be more appealing to organisations making the move from on-premises Windows servers. 

One of the main appeals of Microsoft Azure is the way the availability zones are managed. The Azure regions are separated by national borders or geopolitical lines, making this more appropriate for industries with strong governance requirements, such as banking or healthcare. 

When an organisation is deciding which cloud service to adopt, there are a number of factors to consider and no one provider is best at everything. 
- For flexibility and range of services being run, then AWS provides the best flexibility.
- For integration and support for existing Microsoft products, such as SQL and Windows, then Azure is the clear choice.
- For services that are completely cloud based, and no local infrastructure is required (such as SME and start-ups), then Google may be the most appropriate choice.
