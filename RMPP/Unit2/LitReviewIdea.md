# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines

## Brief
Start planning your literature review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in unit 1. Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4 before final submission in unit 7. You can use the guidance document for the outline submission, and to prepare your review.

You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8 before final submission in unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focused on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation.

## Reflection

There are two areas within my wider life that can benefit from extended research in the Computer Science discipline:
- The first is my employer. As the Oncology IT Systems manager, I am responsible for the digital infrastructure in use within the Oncology service. Over the years, multiple digital solutions have been implemented to solve specific problems, with little strategic oversight. I would like to implement either a Data Architecture (Price _et. al._, 2025) solution that will bring data from all systems in use into a data warehouse to provide useful Business Intelligence, or at the very least complete one cycle of TOGAF (Desfray and Raymond, 2014), documenting the current state, and identifying areas for improvement. 
- The second is my wife is launching an eCommerce service, selling [jewellery online](www.nuggetandco.co.uk). I would like to support her, and use my knowledge of Enterprise IT Management to ensure maximum benefits. 

The solution required for the Oncology architecture will provide a change in the status quo, and will ultimately result in a tangible artefact, making it the ideal choice for the capstone project. Further consideration is needed to hone down the scope of the project and determine an end product that will both satisfy my organisations needs, and fulfil the requirements of the MSc programme.  

The options provided for literature review include _"Digital Marketing of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, in a city of your choice"_. This aligns nicely with my desire to support my wife, and will provide information to inform the digital marketing strategy for Nugget & Co. This will be the ideal option for the Assignment 1 Literature Review. 

## Starting Questions

#### 1. What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience

The aim of the review is to provide an overview of digital marketing strategies for small to medium enterprises, to inform the direction of a start-up eCommerce company (nugget & Co.). The director of this company is the target audience. 

#### 2. Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?

In recent years, the jewellery market has been shifting, towards demi-fine pieces, which fall between traditional fine jewellery and more affordable fashion accessories (James and Dutta, 2025). This has been driven by the buying habits of younger generations (Millennial's and Gen Z), who opt increasingly for online purchases. It is this corner of the market that Nugget & Co. wish to capture.
