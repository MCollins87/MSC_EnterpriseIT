**Case Study:** Medical Implant Risk Analysis  

The Medical Implant Risk Analysis case study from ACM (2023) demonstrates an actual ethical challenge which developers of health technology systems must handle. The medical technology company Corazón created an implantable heart monitoring device which depends on wireless encryption and mobile system integration. The company follows ACM Code of Ethics principles through its practices which support Principles 1.1 (Contribute to society and human well-being), 2.5 (Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations) and 2.9 (Design and implement systems that are robustly and securely usable). The implementation of a hard-coded initialization value in the system created doubts about future data protection and patient security.

The company showed its commitment to Principle 2.3 (Know and respect existing rules) and Principle 3.7 (Recognize and take special care of systems integrated into society’s infrastructure) through its independent researcher consultation and ongoing bug bounty program maintenance.

The company followed BCS Code of Conduct (2021) principles through its public interest commitment and professional competence demonstration. The company solved the problem through teamwork which protected public health and strengthened their professional standards (Dawson, 2015).

The legal and social aspects of Corazón's situation demonstrate that organizations must follow GDPR data protection rules because patient information falls under sensitive data categories. The company maintains public trust through its ethical approach to data management which demonstrates computing professionals' social duties. The case demonstrates that proper risk management combined with ethical conduct forms the base for long-term technological progress and public trust in technology.

# My response

Farhad, thank you for your analysis. You are correct that Corazón acted in line with ethical principles through its social benefit programme, engagement with independent researchers, and proactive monitoring via a bug-bounty scheme. These actions demonstrate a commitment to public good, transparency, and responsible data protection consistent with ACM and BCS expectations.

However, Corazón cannot be viewed as fully compliant with all aspects of either code. The case study ends at the point where the vulnerability was assessed as negligible, with no evidence of what followed. Without confirmation of whether Corazón notified relevant regulators (as required under the BCS _Duty to Relevant Authority_ and medical device regulations on GOV.UK (2025)) or updated its clinical safety documentation under DCB0129 (2018), compliance cannot be assumed. Ethical and professional standards require not only identifying and assessing risks but also documenting, communicating, and monitoring them. The absence of this information leaves an open question about the completeness of Corazón’s ethical and regulatory response.
