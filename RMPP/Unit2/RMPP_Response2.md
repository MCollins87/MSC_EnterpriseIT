The case study “Malware” examines Rogue Services, a web hosting company that promotes “cheap, guaranteed uptime” while supporting clients who distribute malware and spam. Rogue persists in allowing malicious activities that exploit browser vulnerabilities and spread ransomware, showcasing significant ethical, legal, and professional failures in computing practices.

Applying deductive reasoning, Rogue’s actions clearly breach established principles within the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), which mandates that professionals “avoid harm” (Principle 1.2), “be honest and trustworthy” (Principle 1.3), and “respect privacy” (Principle 1.6). By enabling cybercriminals to breach data and harm systems, Rogue undermines public trust. Conversely, inductive reasoning drawn from repeated industry cases suggests a broader trend in which hosting providers prioritise uptime and profit over ethical accountability, highlighting systemic governance issues.

The BCS Code of Conduct (2023) highlights the obligation to “protect the public interest” and “uphold the profession’s reputation.” Neglecting these duties undermines professional integrity and ethical computing. Hosting or facilitating ransomware attacks could violate the UK Computer Misuse Act (1990), GDPR (2018), and international laws such as the U.S. CFAA.

This case underscores the importance of professional codes in promoting responsible behaviour, strengthening governance, and ensuring that technology benefits society.

Hi David,

Your analysis of Rogue Services' unethical behavior stands as a strong and easy-to-understand evaluation. The ACM (2018) principles require Rogue Services to stop supporting malicious clients because their actions violate both harm prevention and honesty maintenance. The situation demonstrates how financial gains can surpass ethical responsibilities which matches the patterns of industry breakdowns studied by Finn and Shilton (2023).

The BCS (2023) Code becomes essential in this situation because protecting public interests stands as the main duty for professional computer scientists. Rogue Services violates ethical standards and faces potential legal consequences because they operate malware and ransomware services which violate GDPR and the UK Computer Misuse Act (1990).

Service providers should implement proactive auditing systems with automated threat detection capabilities to detect misuse at its onset. According to Deckard (2023) digital service ethical governance requires transparent systems which promote accountability to build trust with society.

Your evaluation demonstrates how professional ethics intersect with cybersecurity law and public responsibility in this situation.

# My response

David and Farhad, thank you for your insightful analysis. This case raises one of the core issues of the modern digital world - that of national jurisdiction on a global platform (Gstrein and Zwitter, 2021). 

You have both correctly identified the ethical failings of Rouge Services, however I think it is worth examining the ethical practices of the security vendors who developed a work to take Rouge off-line. Whilst both  ACM (2018) and BCS (2021) have principles relating to public good, which arguably this was the purpose of the worm, consequences of the worm were that legitimate customers Rouge experienced harm (data loss). 

This is where the more prescriptive nature of the ACM has its advantages. The code explicitly uses the term "unjustified [...] harm". Harm caused to malicious users of Rouge Services is arguably justified, however is the harm to the other customers justified, and should the work authors have taken additional steps to prevent this collateral damage?
