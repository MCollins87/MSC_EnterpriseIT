For this initial collaborative discussion post, I have decided to review the ACM Case Study for Automated Active Response Weaponry (Association for Computing Machinery, no date). This fictional case study describes the gradual development of autonomous vehicles to include non-lethal autonomous weapon systems, and discussions regarding requests and the potential development of lethal autonomous weapon systems. In response to the intention to develop lethal weapon systems, several engineers resigned, planning to speak out publicly against known risks with non-lethal systems, and against the development of lethal systems. The engineers were sued for breaches of confidentiality. 

It also makes reference to the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Association of Computing Machinery, 2018), citing a number of potential breaches of the code. This included the technology itself, breaching a number of principles, including, amongst others, that development of machines intended to cause harm being ethically justified and minimises unintended harms, that the intended use risks breaching human rights. 

Further discussion within the case study makes reference to the engineers speaking out (“whistle blowing”) being consistent with the code, whilst conversely the company’s intended legal action against the engineers for speaking out also being justified. It also considered that the leadership team breached the code by failing to take due consideration of the code’s overarching duty to serve the public good.

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is analogous in many ways to the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, 2022). The BCS contains similar principles that would apply to the same scenario, particularly Principle 1: Public Interest, which requires its members to consider, amongst other things, the public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others. 

Overall, this scenario illustrates the potential complexity of scenarios that are becoming increasingly relevant as artificial intelligence and autonomous machinery becomes more common. It also underlines the potentially competing requirements of the relevant codes, identifying the need for professionals subject to the code to remain aware of and consider their professional responsibilities.

Thank-you James for your thought provoking analysis of the "Automated Active Response Weaponry" Case study (ACM, no date). 

What I find interesting is the highlighting the apparent double standard of both whistle-blowing being consistent with BCS (BCS, 2021) and ACM (ACM, 2018),, but also that the company following legal proceedings against the former employees being justified. 

The case study does not provide details on how the engineers planned to disclose potentially sensitive information. Assuming this occurred in the UK, there are a number of mechanisms in which the Engineers could adhere to the codes of ethics, particularly in relation to public interest by raising awareness, whilst minimising their exposure to legal repercussions. _The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998_ provides protection to whistle-blowers, however the Act defines who information can be disclosed to to remain protected under the act. In this particular case, as a Government contractor Section 43E would be relevant _"Disclosure to Minister of the Crown"_ i.e. a member of parliament. 

I would criticise the company for failing to follow sections 1, 2 and 3 of the ACM code - neglecting harm prevention, public good, and professional responsibility, and ethical leadership. They also violated all four sections of the BCS code. 

The case study states that the engineers had already raised concerns, yet no action was taken. This violates section 3 of the ACM code, particularly 3.4 _"Articulate, apply, and support policies and procedures that reflect the principles of the code"_. UK government guidance (Department for Business Innovation & Skills, 2015)  advises that there is _"at least one senior member of staff as a point of contact for individuals who wish to blow the whistle"_. 

While the Engineers were right to follow the code of ethics and report the activities, the company is also justified for suing their former employees. However, I believe that the engineers have a good legal defence as the company failed to provide a clear method of raising concerns and also failed in their ethical duties.
