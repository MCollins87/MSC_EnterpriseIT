# Peer Review Activity

## Chosen papers

The topic of my Literature review is "Digital Marketing of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, in a city of your choice."  I will be focusing this on the area of Jewellery, as I have a vested interest in an existing [Jewellery eCommerce company](www.nuggetandco.co.uk). 

Two papers chosen are James and Dutta (2025) and Tam and Lung (2025). Both are Literature reviews in themselves, looking at digital marketing for luxury fashion from slightly different points of view. 

#### Purpose and aim
The primary purpose of James and Dutta (2025) is to act as a teaching aid - outlining the market position of fine and semi-fine jewellery and the challenges faced in each of the digital marketing methods.

In contrast, Tam and Lung (2025) is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) looking at digital marketing strategies, their efficacy and using three high-end luxury brands as case studies.

#### Research Methodology used

James and Dutta (2025) has a qualitative approach where the conclusion being a list of questions to consider when approaching digital marketing of fine jewellery online.

Tam and Lung (2025) has a quantitative approach, identifying discrete digital marketing strategies, and further categorising them. 

#### Data collection, analysis and evidence used

James and Dutta (2025) fails to provide detailed references, and it is not clear what data has been used for their research. They have posed questions for the reader to consider, but have not provided evidence that the challenges exist. 

Tam and Lung (2025) on the other hand provides details of their SLR process, and their filtering criteria, providing clear reasoning of their conclusion. 

#### Enhancements
Tam and Lung (2025) is a very good SLR providing clear reasoning. Improvements would be to widen the scope. Rather than focus on existing luxury brands, and the strategies they have employed, results on the efficacy of each strategy would be useful. i.e. is it possible to measure the impact on revenue from each strategy?

James and Dutta (2025) on the other hand fails to fully cite sources. Whilst there are in-line citations, most are non-academic in nature, and there is no list of references.
