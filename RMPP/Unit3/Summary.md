Farhad, Abdulrahman, and Mustafa,

Thank you all for your responses and insightful input. There appears to be a theme in a number of these case studies, which agrees with previous ethics training I have received, and that is "The cover-up is worse than the crime".

As I started my career in Medical Physics, there was a high profile case in the french courts (Seillan, 2013), where Medical Physicists were prosecuted and convicted not only for their negligence, but also for the destruction of documents in an attempt to cover-up. The actions following the incident to hide the error were the deciding factor to impose a custodial sentence on those involved.

Over the last 15 years, I have personally seen how legislation and standards have evolved in response to ethical failings. DCB0129 (2018) and GOV.UK (2025) for instance is require software used in healthcare to continuously monitored, and clinical safety files to be updated.

DCB0129 (2018) and DCB0160 (2018) provide mechanisms for managing risk, and the Clinical Safety File provides a clear method of communication from the manufacturer to the clinical end user. It is this communication that stands out as the application of ethics. Software engineers are human, and mistakes will be made. It is how these mistakes are handled that shows true ethical practice. This principle can be applied to many of the BCS (2021) standards, in particular "The Duty to Relevant Authority".
