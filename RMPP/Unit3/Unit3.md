## Seminar
This weeks seminar activity was a [peer review activity:](./SeminarPrep.md)

_In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3: “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject._

_In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:_
- _Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?_
- _Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?_
- _In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)_
- _Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?_
- _How would you enhance the work/paper?_
