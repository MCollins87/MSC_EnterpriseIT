# Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods

It is crucial to understand that any methodology choice is based on some underlying assumptions, which we need to bring awareness to. As Saunders et al. (2023) clearly states, you, the researcher, ‘are going to have assumptions about the realities you encounter in your research (ontological assumptions), about human knowledge (epistemological assumptions), and about the extent and ways your own values influence your research process (axiological assumptions). These assumptions inevitably shape how you understand your research questions, the methods you use and how you interpret your findings.’

Before going into the research methods, it is beneficial to understand Research Design. Research design refers to having a plan about what you plan to do in order to answer your research question (Saunders et al., 2023). Hence, you will need to be sure of the research strategies and methods you will employ for data collection and your analysis. 

### There Are Two Types of Research Design:

**Exploratory Research:** where, as the name suggests, specific aspects of a research area are explored. The problem is not clearly defined, so there cannot be a conclusive result from the research. Instead, there will be a better understanding of the problem or situation. An example of Exploratory Research is where a company wants to carry out an investigation into the effectiveness of Customer Relationship Management in mobile marketing. 

**Conclusive Research:** being the opposite of exploratory research, the focus is more specific – to verify insights and aid in selecting a course of action (BRM, n.d.). One key category of this type of research design is **Descriptive Research**, where the aim is to describe elements or causes in the specified research area. An example of Descriptive Research is a focus on social media where you undertake a critical analysis of this tool as a marketing strategy.

| Research Methods | Qualitative Research |
| --- | --- |
| This refers to the “systematic tools used to find, collect, analyse and interpret information” (Sage, 2021). So, understanding which research method to adopt for your project is essential as it will determine the type of data you collect and analyse, in order to answer your research question. The three main types of Research methods are Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Research. | This refers to a research method used to gather data about experiences, behaviours and emotions from a predetermined set of respondents. This type of research is useful in exploring how or why something has occurred and interpreting the events and outcomes. Inductive approaches are associated with qualitative research. |

### The Tools and Techniques Used to Gather Qualitative Research Are:
- Focus groups (Covered in Unit 4).
- Case studies (Covered in Unit 4).
- Observations (Covered in Unit 4). 
- Surveys/Questionnaires (Covered in Unit 5).
- Interviews (Covered in Unit 5). 

**Quantitative Research:** refers to a research method used to gather numerical data to which statistical analysis can be applied. It focuses on discovering patterns and/or relationships and can therefore be used to make generalisations. So, the main questions being explored using this method are “how much?”, “how many?” and “to what extent?”. Deductive approaches are associated with quantitative research.

The tools and techniques used to gather quantitative research data are a few, some in common with qualitative methods (surveys, case studies), others more typical of quantitative methods (design of experiments, IoT/sensor/ satellite data, big data, etc).

**Mixed Methods Research:** integrates both qualitative and quantitative research to provide a holistic approach to a research project.

Conducting research based on any research method involves 2 methods for data collection:
- Primary research, where information is gathered directly from the subject using.
- Secondary research, where data is gathered from previously published primary research, like published case studies and articles, magazines, newspapers, books, etc.

## Seminar
This weeks seminar activity was a [peer review activity:](./SeminarPrep.md)

_In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3: “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject._

_In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:_
- _Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?_
- _Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?_
- _In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)_
- _Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?_
- _How would you enhance the work/paper?_
