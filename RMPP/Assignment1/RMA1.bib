Thereafter, using natural language processing algorithms, this study has classified the triggers of positive eWOM based on their relative importance across six product categories.The most important triggers of positive eWOM (like product experience, product type, product characteristics) were similar across different product categories. The second-level antecedents of positive eWOM included the person(s) for whom the product is purchased, the price and the source of the product, packaging and eagerness in patronising a brand.The findings of this study indicate that the marketers who are active in the digital forum should encourage and incentivise their satisfied consumers to disseminate positive eWOM. Consumers with special interest for any product type (mothers or doctors for baby food) may be incentivised to write positive eWOM about the product's ingredients/characteristics. Companies can launch the sequels of existing television or online advertisements addressing ``for whom the product is purchased''.This study identified the triggers of the positive eWOM using real-time Big Data extracted from online purchase platforms. This study also contributes to the literature by identifying the levels of triggers that are most, more and moderately important to the customers for writing positive reviews online.},

  abstract = {Technological advancements within social commerce platforms, such as ``action buttons'' on Facebook or Instagram (e.g., the ``Shop'' button), have simplified how customers interact with brands, leading to greater impulse buying opportunities. Using a mixed methodology in two studies involving Instagram users in the United States (US), this research conceptualizes (Study 1) and operationalizes (Study 2) a higher-order model of consumer motivation for social commerce engagement as a hierarchical construct that drives the urge to impulse buy. Further, consumer--brand identification and perceived social risk of commenting are included in the proposed framework. Results show consumer motives of brand intimacy, shopping planning, entertainment, channel advantage, remuneration, and escapism influence impulse buying. Findings further identify consumer--brand identification as a mediating mechanism between consumer motivation and the urge for impulse buying, which also neutralizes the negative moderating effect of the perceived social risk of commenting on social platforms. This study contributes to motivation and impulse buying theory as well as social commerce practice. The findings inform content marketing activities seeking to heighten customers' urge for impulse buying and mitigate contingency variables. This study also acknowledges related ethical considerations, including the need for brands to understand the urge to impulse buying behaviors to ensure responsible marketing practices that align with principles of consumer well-being.},

Moreover, while eudaimonia plays a particular role in women's behavior, hedonism works likewise on desires.A crucial decision before developing content marketing is to consider if the final result is to produce desirability or feasibility in consumers. Content marketing addressing eudaimonia will impact feasibility; while the content aims to create desirability, the hedonic aspect of happiness should be emphasized.Though content marketing and the effect of content marketing on brands' performance and consumer decision processes has been deeply analyzed in the literature, there is a lack of research into the effect of such content on consumers' well-being. Another contribution of this study is the focus on local brands and on women's eudaimonia and hedonism.},

That's 2.16 times the original acquisition + possible marketing cost of jewelry. Most searched: Looking at data between 2017-2022, the most searched jewelry category is rings, with engagement rings being the most popular ring-related search on Google. Jewelry market size How big is the jewelry market? According to Grand View Research, the global jewelry market value in 2023 is USD 340.69 billion. This number is based on 2022 end data. For comparison, in 2014, the global jewelry market was valued at USD 157 billion. During the past nine years, the jewelry market value has grown by \$183 billion, more than doubling in size. In fact, these figures have made jewelry one of the fastest-growing segments in fashion during the past five years. Let's decode these numbers. How about the online jewelry market? With eCommerce sales contributing \$57.4 billion, approximately 16.7\% of all jewelry sales are made online. For comparison, in 2021, online sales represented roughly 8.1\% of global jewelry sales. This means that the transition from brick-and-mortar stores to eCommerce has been prevalent during the past few years. Since eCommerce accounts for 20.8\% of all retail sales, the jewelry market has experienced a slightly slower transition online than the average product. The global online jewelry market is forecast to reach \$117.3 billion in size by 2027. This means that online jewelry is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 19.56\%. Which country spends the most on jewelry? With an expenditure of USD 111.5 billion, China~buys, produces, and consumes~the most jewelry.

United Kingdom \$6.63 billion 1.95\% The United States valued at \$69.1 billion, is the second biggest jewelry market in the world, while India is the third-largest jewelry market with \$51.4 billion. How big is the jewelry market in the US? The jewelry market in the United States is currently valued at \$69 billion. It is the second-largest country by jewelry market value, only shadowed by the gigantic \$141.1 billion jewelry market in China. The US jewelry market is currently 51.1\% smaller than the jewelry market in China. However, the US Jewelry market is over twice (111\%) the size of the jewelry market of Europe. The online jewelry market in the United States is valued at \$9.8 billion, meaning that 14.2\% of all jewelry sales in the US happen online. Although the United States jewelry market is only 20\% of the global jewelry market value, 38.18\% of all online sales worldwide take place in the US. What about the jewelry market value in Europe? According to Statista, the current European jewelry segment market is valued at US\$34.73 billion (EUR 32.2 billion). This number is reported as a 7.1\% increase from the previous year when Europe generated US\$32.42 billion (EUR 30.06 billion) in jewelry segment revenue. 27\% of the jewelry market in Europe comes from the luxury goods market, while the remaining 73\% is from non-luxury goods. What is the jewelry market growth rate? Based on the market data from 2014-2022, the current compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the global jewelry market is 6.96\%. The estimated growth rates for the global jewelry market range from 3.1-8.5\%, giving us the average estimated annual growth expectation of 5.8\% CAGR from 2022-2030. Online jewelry market, on the other hand, has experienced an annual average growth of 8.64\% during 2011-2019. It is is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.56\% until 2027.

As stated in~the jewelry market research from GWI, married average-income women between the ages 25-34 buy the most jewelry, while 45-54-year-old people with an annual income of \$200,000 spend the most money on jewelry. 44\% of men have bought jewelry during their lives, in comparison to 56\% of women. As for marital status, 55\% of all jewelry purchases were made by married people. Single people accounted for 30\%, and people in a relationship only 12\% of jewelry expenditure globally. 22\% of all jewelry buyers are between 35-44 years old, while merely 4\% buy jewelry after the age of 55. When it comes to countries with the most generated jewelry revenue in relation to population size, Hong Kong is the clear jewelry hub of the world with a whopping US\$1288.4 annual jewelry revenue generated per capita. Country Annual Jewelry Revenue Generated Per Capita (USD) 1. Hong Kong \$1288.4 2. Singapore \$439.6 3. United States \$187.4 4. Canada \$173.3 5. Australia \$142.07 6. Turkey \$90.4 7.

When it comes to age demographics, 45-54 age group spends the most on jewelry with an average annual spend of US\$304.6 per consumer. Annual Jewelry Spend AverageAmerican Age26-41 Age45-54 Americanhousehold As for total jewelry expenditure by age group, people between the ages 25-34 are the busiest jewelry shoppers, contributing 35\% of all jewelry sales globally. The second-largest age group is the youth (16-24-year-olds), making up 27\% of total jewelry expenditure. Interestingly, young people between the ages of 16 and 34 make up 62\% of all jewelry buyers. In contrast, the older half of the population (aged 45 and above) only make up 16\% of global jewelry shoppers. Average American jewelry expenditure annually According to the data collected between 2018-2020, the average American spends \$78.14 on jewelry every year, while the average American household spends a whopping \$434.3 on jewelry purchases annually. In 2020, the average American spent 35\% less on jewelry than during the previous year. During the four-year period of 2016-2020, the American household jewelry expenditure rose a total of 15.3\%. According to the data by Trading Economics, Americans earn \$27.07 in wage/hour. This means that the average American buys 2.9 working hours worth of jewelry every year. How much do millennials spend on jewelry? Based on the data from the United States, the average millennial spends \$203 on jewelry annually. This number was calculated by multiplying the total jewelry spend in the US (average jewelry expenditure per capita in the US \$78.14 x the US population count 329m) with the global jewelry spend accounted by millennials as a percentage of total spend (57\%) and dividing it with the number of millennials in the US (72.1m). In the US, the average millennial spends 157.9\% more on jewelry~than~the average American. Although millennials account for 23\% of the total world population, they make up 57\% of all jewelry expenditure globally.~ What age group wears the most jewelry? When it comes to wearing jewelry, the youth and young adults are the most enthusiastic. The numbers confirm the popularity of jewelry among young adults, as the 16-44 age group constitutes 82\% of all jewelry purchases in the world. This doesn't necessarily mean that elderly folks don't like to wear jewelry. Perhaps they simply have purchased their favorite jewelry pieces already and are now mainly focused on wearing their prized possessions. Sources: GWI, Statista 1, Statista 2,~EdahnGolan, TradingEconomics,~WorldEconomicForum Most popular jewelry types What type of jewelry sells the most? According to the research, women are most inclined to buy earrings, while men like necklaces the most. When considering the whole population, necklaces are the top-selling jewelry category. 87\% of women say they wear earrings regularly, while 64\% wear a necklace, and 47\% a bracelet daily. Surprisingly, only approximately half of all women (53\%) wear rings on a daily basis. What is the most popular jewelry today? When looking at the broad jewelry categories, necklaces are the most popular jewelry today. According to a 2019 study based on 1003 respondents in France, rings were the most worn jewelry type (60\%) with necklaces (57\%) coming in a close second. Here is some detailed data about jewelry popularity by category; Necklaces: The most popular necklace type is a solitaire pendant (64\% prefer it over any other necklace style), while 66\% of women prefer a separate chain and pendant, and 34\% like the chain attached. Earrings: 70\% of women prefer a round-cut stone on their stud earrings, and with 41\% choosing 1-1.5 carats over any other stone size, the most wanted earrings are studs with 1-carat, round-cut diamond. Bracelets: Tennis bracelets received the most love with 51\% of women choosing them over other bracelets (bangles were the second favorite style with 26\% selecting them). In addition, 47\% of women prefer to wear their bracelets in stacks, while only 39\% like to wear a single bracelet at a time. Rings: Only 11\% of jewelry-inclined women don't like to wear rings, while 52\% choose statement rings and 37\% band rings over other ring types. Sources:~DiamondNexus, Tiffany, Statista Pricing and cost of jewelry How much does jewelry cost? According to the data collected from 117 American jewelers in September 2016, the average retail price for jewelry is \$804, and the median price is \$350. Considering the average combined gross profit margin from the two leading jewelers in the world, Signet Jewelers \&amp; Tiffany and Co (recently acquired by LVMH), is 49,1\%, jewelers can expect to pay \$394 for the average priced jewelry item, and \$172 for the median price item before listing the item for sale. The 2016 study only looked at jewelry in the United States priced between \$40-\$10,000 and excluded engagement rings and wedding bands. However, since the vast majority of sold jewelry is made from precious metals such as gold and silver (globally priced commodities), and the two largest jewelers make up a significant part (\textasciitilde 5\%) of the global jewelry market it gives a fairly clear picture of the overall cost of jewelry worldwide. Now that we know how much jewelry costs, let's find out what people prefer to actually pay for their jewelry. How much can you sell jewelry for? Based on the market data from two of the largest jewelry businesses in the world, you can expect to sell jewelry for 1.6-2.7 times its original acquisition price (including any possible marketing costs of the product). In 2021, Signet Jewelers Limited sold jewelry for \$7.826 billion (operating revenue), and their cost of revenue was \$4.702 billion, leaving an average markup of 66.4\%. In 2020, Tiffany \&amp; Co reported a revenue of \$4.424 billion and a \$1.662 billion cost of revenue, showing an average markup of 166.2\%. The combined average jewelry markup for Signet Jewelers and Tiffany \&amp; Co is 116.3\%. It's a 2.16 multiplier on the original total cost of revenue. Here's what a typical jewelry business pricing model looks like based on these numbers: (PRODUCT ACQUISITION COSTS + EXPECTED PRODUCT MARKETING COSTS PER UNIT SOLD) x 2.16 If you are thinking about starting a jewelry business, you can expect to sell your jewelry with a 60-170\% markup on the original acquisition price (including possible product marketing costs). When looking at the largest and most successful jewelry businesses in the world, we can see that Tiffany \&amp; Co has a 62.22\% gross profit margin (2016-2020), and Signet Jewelers has a 35.98\% gross profit margin from the same time period. Sources: NationalJeweler, YahooFinance, Investing,~CSIMarket, Statista 1, Statista 2, Statista 3 Jewelry trends and insights What kind of jewelry is the trendiest? According to the search trends compiled by Google, rings are the trendiest jewelry category in the world. This is confirmed by the data from keyword planner, which suggests rings are the most searched jewelry-related topic on Google with over 2.2 million average monthly searches during 2020-2022. Interestingly, the second most popular jewelry category, according to keyword planner, is engagement rings with 1.8 million monthly searches on average. How about in the US jewelry market? The United Stated jewelry market mirrors the global jewelry market, meaning that the most fashionable jewelry type in the US is also rings, closely followed by earrings as the second most popular type of jewelry. Another popular jewelry category today is pearls. As reported by Vogue, pearl jewelry has seen a +156\% increase in searches in 2020 when compared to the previous year. Sources:~Google 1, Vogue,~Google 2 Conclusion That's a wrap for my roundup of jewelry market statistics. The sheer size of the jewelry market is what impressed me the most - and the fact that it's still growing. Also, the amount of data available about the global jewelry market on the internet is colossal. If you didn't find something you desperately needed from my article, searching the internet for any free data or purchasing an in-depth jewelry market analysis from an authoritative source are your two best alternatives.

  abstract = {We have identified an emerging tool being used by the UK government across a range of public bodies in the service of public policy - the online targeted advertising infrastructure and the practices, consultancy firms, and forms of expertise which have grown up around it. This reflects an intensification and adaptation of a broader `behavioural turn' in the governmentality of the UK state and the increasing sophistication of everyday government communications. Contemporary UK public policy is fusing with the powerful tools for behaviour change created by the platform economy. Operational data and associated systems of classification and profiling from public bodies are being hybridised with traditional consumer marketing profiles and then `projected' onto the classification systems of the targeted advertising infrastructures. This is not simply a case of algorithms being used for sorting, surveilling, and scoring; rather this suggests that targeted interventions in the cultural and behavioural life of communities are now a core part of governmental power which is being algorithmically-driven, in combination with influencer networks, traditional forms of messaging, and frontline operational practices. We map these uses and practices of what we describe as the `Surveillance Influence Infrastructure', identifying key ethical issues and implications which we believe have yet to be fully investigated or considered. What we find particularly striking is the coming-together of two separate structures of power - the governmental turn to behaviourism and prevention on one hand, and the infrastructures of targeting and influence (and their complex tertiary markets) on the other. We theorise this as a move beyond `nudge' or `behavioural science' approaches, towards a programme which we term `influence government'.},

Generation Z is called digital natives as they have been exposed to the internet, social networks, and mobile systems from an early age. Driving intent to purchase for this target segment is crucial for brands. Hence, this study develops a model for measuring SMMA and validates the nomological model by verifying its influence on Purchase Intention. The paper uses 24 items on a five-dimensional scale for measuring SMMA for Gen Z. The items were generated from the literature review and focus group interviews. 310 responses were collected. After data cleaning, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was run on 290 responses using SPSS version 27. The study revealed that SMMA is a four-dimensional construct with 20 variables. Electronic- Word Of Mouth (e- WOM), Interaction, Customisation, and Advertisements were the four dimensions. To further validate the nomological model, the impact of SMMA on the Purchase Intention (PI) of Gen Z was studied using multiple linear regression. The analysis confirmed the validity of the scale by describing the impact on PI for Gen Z. Customisation, Advertisements, and Interaction had a significant influence on Purchase Intention. The study theoretically confirms the constructs defining SMMA in line with previous research. It specifically outlines the measurement for Gen Z, practically enabling brands to identify the significant factors to focus on to capture the Gen Z market through social media marketing.},

Theory of planned behaviour model is applied to understand the Generation Z ethical consumerism.Qualitative method in the form of 18 semi-structured interviews was conducted on participants aged within the Generation Z cohort in the UK.Research findings show that Generation Z has strong awareness and desire towards ethical and environmental issues. Driven in the main by the cohorts unlimited exposure to social media platforms and online resources where information is shared. Generation Z's frugality limits them to purchase truly ethically in their current life stage. Financial aspirations from this target market suggest a future desire to purchase high value ethical items. Further trends discovered highlighted sustainable lifestyle choices within the generation. Recycling, diet choices and reduced consumption on clothing were expressed. The paper highlights that Generation Z are aware of ethical issues prevalent in society and are doing what they can at this life stage to make a positive impact.This research has valuable implications for both academics and marketers. It provides new insights for scholars into understanding Generation Z decision-making in ethical consumption. It successfully applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour to understand generational consumer behaviour. The findings can assist practitioners to determine effective marketing strategies to persuade Generation Z to act ethically. The research can also be considered when dealing with government legislation when tackling social change in younger population as this appeared important factor for the researched consumers. Marketers should also consider digital influencers as part of their communication campaigns targeting Generation Z users.This search offers a valuable contribution to current academic findings towards Generation Z research as ethical consumers incorporating TPB framework.},

This study contributes to the emerging literature on B-to-B SMEs digital marketing by determining the mechanism through which B-to-B SMEs may benefit from using the social media in their efforts to export.Despite the promising potential of the social media, especially for export-oriented companies, very limited attention has hitherto been paid to the relationship between the use of social media and export performance.

To what extent is it possible to optimize over time the resources allocated to positioning a brand on search engines? Often keyword costs are understood as monetary costs and the literature on keyword auctions suggests convergence towards a long-run equilibrium expenditure path. However, search engine optimization techniques, associated with implicit costs, have mainly focused on the short run. This paper suggests drawing long-term inferences from estimated cost per click, as the economic cost of organic keywords. Web analytics software is used to gather these data for leading fashion e-commerce. A time series test of transition dynamics identifies convergence of economic keyword costs between branded and generic keywords or catch-up, as an early state of convergence, for almost all considered e-commerce.},

It provides a seamless and integrated customer experience across all available communication channels. MSMEs play a crucial role in developing economies, but their journey towards omnichannel integration faces significant challenges due to limited resources, managerial commitment, and technological adaptability. This study explores the stages of transformation towards omnichannel adoption among micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in fashion and furniture, as representative subsectors of Indonesia's creative economy, focusing on the dynamic capabilities. This research addresses the gap in understanding how different MSMEs navigate these challenges through various stages of transformation. Using a multiple case study approach, the research investigates two MSMEs in fashion and furniture industries through in-depth interviews and document analysis. Findings reveal that fashion MSMEs leverage real-time inventory management and personalized customer engagement for rapid integration, whereas furniture MSMEs adopt incremental approaches focused on logistical efficiency and collaboration with external partners. By emphasizing sector-specific applications of dynamic capabilities---sensing, seizing, and transforming---this study underscores the importance of collaborative alliances and leadership in addressing operational challenges. Practical implications include strategies for MSMEs to enhance competitiveness through tailored omnichannel solutions. These insights offer practical implications for MSMEs aiming to enhance their competitive edge through omnichannel strategies.},

Micro and Small-sized enterprises account for a large amount items sold in Amazon shops. Amazon has developed a list of practical resources, tools, and chances to assist small companies. It is hypothesized that small businesses that sell in Amazon stores outperform those that do not sell in Amazon stores in terms of revenue growth. The objective of this study is to check this hypothesis. The data came from micro and small businesses (2-50 employees) in the United States. The data is balanced panel data of 139 micro and small business for 2 years (n=139, t=2). This study used Fixed Effect (FE), and Random Effect (RE) models. The results seem to support the hypothesis that selling on Amazon positively impacts the revenue growth of SMEs.

Our findings caution against simply adopting approaches from non-luxury contexts as they risk undermining the luxury service experience. Rather, we develop a set of propositions at the intersections of the physical, digital, and social realms on how luxury brands can adapt the use of digital multi-actor interactions to augment rather than imperil their brand image. Specifically, our propositions help luxury managers to enhance the customer experience through hedonic escapism, strengthen their brand communities, and use digitization to simultaneously provide conspicuous customers with greater visibility and discreet customers with social exclusivity.},

Modern World consumers seeking reasonably priced luxury, expressive style, and ethical sourcing are drawn to demi-fine jewellery, which mostly features gold vermeil, sterling silver, and semiprecious stones. The trend is being driven by millennials and Gen Z, who desire design-oriented, multipurpose products that can be purchased online. Low category knowledge, customer distrust, pricing perception issues, and challenges with both online and offline retail presence are still big challenges in the business. In order to overcome these challenges, social media marketing technologies are a key instrument. Thanks to social media's hyper-personalized outreach, influencer marketing and direct-to-consumer engagement capabilities, demi-fine brands are able to build trust, educate consumers, and successfully expand their market presence. A possible new frontier for retail jewellery sales could be demi-fine diamonds, according to the study's investigation into how the internet revolution is altering luxury spending in the World.},

The study evaluates these influencer types across both for-profit and not-for-profit messaging contexts to determine how message intent influences audience reactions. The findings reveal that HVIs can be as effective as human influencers, especially in not-for-profit messaging, where their authenticity and source credibility are higher. However, when the messaging shifts to for-profit motives, the advantage of HVIs diminishes, aligning more closely with AVIs, which consistently show lower effectiveness.

Gone are the days when consumers were diffident in buying online as they had issues of quality, quantity, trust, payment, delivery mode, price etc. Marketers came up with a number of strategies to encourage online buying.The last decade has seen a rise in customers buying all types of product categories be it FMCG, food, books, apparel, consumer durables, furniture, medicines and even jewellery. Buying jewellery in India is mostly a family affair and is an emotional process. Be it jewellery for investment, gifting, occasions like birth of child, marriage, religious functions, festivals, each piece of jewellery bought has emotions attached. Most Indians had their fixed favourite family jewellers from whom the purchase was done. With advent of ecommerce, major jeweller brands started selling through online mode. They rolled out different strategies to attract customers to buy jewellery online. They left no stone unturned to motivate the online buyers. A paradigm shift was observed as customers moved from offline to online for purchase of different kinds of jewellery.This paper focuses on understanding marketing strategies adopted by major jewellers and the varied buying behaviour of Indian consumers for online purchase of jewellery. The researchers aim to understand how a high involvement product like jewellery could be showcased to its customers and customers lured to purchase from a virtual store rather than the traditional brick and mortar store. The researchers collected secondary data from several research papers to understand consumer's preferences for jewellery both offline and online. Media Reports, Press Releases, Reserve Bank of India, Gem \& Jewellery Export Promotion Council `s reports have been studied to understand the strategies of jewellers as well as customers' acceptance level of the marketing strategies..

  abstract = {Background. Definitions of gamification tend to vary by person, both in industry and within academia. One particularly popular lay interpretation, introduced and popularized by Ian Bogost, and reiterated by Jan Klabbers, is that gamification is ``bullshit'' and ``exploitationware.'' They describe gamification as a marketing term or business practice invented to sell products rather than to represent a real and unique phenomenon relevant to a nascent game science. However, this view is an oversimplification, one which ignores a growing body of theory development and empirical research on gamification within a post-positivist epistemology. In fact, because gamification is so much more outcome-focused than general game design, current gamification research in many ways has a stronger footing in modern social science than much games research does. Aim. In this article, to address common misunderstandings like these, we describe the philosophical underpinnings of modern gamification research, define the relationship between games and gamification, define and situate gamification science as a subdiscipline of game science, and explicate a six-element framework of major concerns within gamification science: predictor constructs, criterion constructs, mediator constructs, moderator constructs, design processes, and research methods. This framework is also presented diagrammatically as a causal path model. Conclusion. Gamification science refers to the development of theories of gamification design and their empirical evaluation within a post-positivist epistemology. The goal of gamification scientist-practitioners should be to understand how to best meet organizational goals through the design of gamification interventions, drawing upon insights derived from both gamification science and games research more broadly.},

  abstract = {The British high street is in a state of demise. Data analysis from The Guardian has revealed that almost every town centre in England and Wales has declined since 2013, with some towns losing over a fifth of their stores. Factors influencing this demise range from Brexit uncertainty, increased rents and business rates, rising operating costs and an increase in online shopping. The aim of this paper is to explore the cult of celebrity, its deployment within social media, and how this has been central to the rise of online retailing, and ultimately, the decline of the British high street. Celebrity culture and the British high street have both been affected by the meteoric rise of the digital age, which has created a shifting retail landscape. The digital age affects how celebrities are discovered, and how they promote themselves to remain relevant. A new celebrity has been born as ordinary individuals find fame by appearing on reality television. These celebrities remain in the public eye, becoming ``influencers,'' and promoting fashion brands through their social media. There is a lack of academic research on the credibility of celebrities within social networks. Instagram influencers have affected clothing on the physical high street, by encouraging consumers to shop online. ``Fast fashion'' can be described as ``low-cost clothing collections that mimic current luxury fashion trends.'' This type of clothing ``helps state deeply held desires among young consumers.'' Young consumers follow reality celebrities on social media, and this impacts their purchasing choices. Drawing from an archive at Nottingham Trent University, this paper explores connections between fast fashion, celebrity and social media, and addresses the shifting retail landscape. Social media platforms like Instagram encourage consumers to buy clothing at the click of a button. This raises debates surrounding the implications of instant gratification on the fashion retail landscape.},

In this context, for instance, AI is used to provide people with personalized newsfeeds to prolong time spent online, which might result in addictive-like behavior. Many factors such as sociodemographic variables, history of psychopathology and personality traits have been revealed as risk factors for developing problematic social media use patterns. Yet, to our knowledge attitudes toward AI have not been examined in association with problematic social media use. In a sample of n = 956 social media users, we observed that positive AI attitudes were linked to overuse of social media as assessed with an addiction framework. The effect size of this association was stronger for males than females. Further we observed that this association was mediated by time spent on social media. The present study shows that positive AI attitudes -- although well-known to be positive regarding embracing new technologies -- might come with risks for developing addictive patterns of technology use, such as social media.},

  abstract = {In an increasingly digitized and data-saturated marketplace, the integration of multi-channel marketing strategies has become essential for organizations aiming to enhance customer engagement, streamline user experiences, and improve return on investment (ROI). This systematic review examines the evolution and effectiveness of integrated digital marketing approaches by synthesizing findings from 85 peer-reviewed studies published between 2005 and 2022. It investigates how the convergence of strategic channel coordination, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven personalization, CRM and CDP infrastructure, behavioral retargeting mechanisms, and ethical data governance collectively influence digital marketing performance across industries and platforms. The review reveals that channel orchestration---defined as the coordinated deployment of marketing messages across platforms such as email, mobile applications, websites, social media, and offline touchpoints---consistently leads to improved digital conversion rates, increased average order values, and reduced decision-making friction. Unlike fragmented campaigns, integrated multi-channel strategies foster a unified brand experience and allow consumers to navigate seamlessly between touchpoints, thereby amplifying message reinforcement and brand recall. A key focus of the study is the role of AI in transforming personalization from a rule-based, reactive function to a predictive and adaptive capability. Machine learning algorithms now enable dynamic content delivery, real-time segmentation, and behavioral prediction, enhancing user engagement and accelerating purchase decisions. The review highlights that organizations employing AI-powered personalization---particularly through product recommendations, adaptive messaging, and retargeting algorithms---demonstrate significant gains in ROI, customer lifetime value, and campaign efficiency. Central to the success of these efforts is the implementation of CRM and customer data platform (CDP) architectures, which serve as the operational backbone for managing real-time data integration and hyper-personalized campaign execution. These infrastructures facilitate the orchestration of customer insights across departments and ensure that every interaction is contextually relevant, timely, and behaviorally informed. The integration of CRM/CDP systems with marketing automation platforms further enables scalable, responsive, and intelligent engagement flows. The synthesis identifies a trend toward trust-based marketing design---marked by the implementation of opt-in frameworks, transparent data usage policies, and explainable AI---that aims to balance personalization goals with consumer autonomy and regulatory compliance.},

Missing completely is a comparison of content marketing with other forms of content, namely sponsored and user-generated content, although these content types are of high relevance for the marketing strategy of a company. To fill this research gap, the present study examines how different content types are perceived and how they influence brand responses through persuasion knowledge. A serial mediation model is developed, which posits that different content types lead to a varying conceptual persuasion knowledge, which then influences the activation of attitudinal persuasion knowledge and in turn results in different brand attitudes. The corresponding model is tested in an experimental study, using different content types in the context of the video game industry. The findings indicate that, through the proposed serial mediation, sponsored content leads to a more negative brand attitude than user-generated content and content marketing. These results suggest that, although coming directly from a company, content marketing seemingly is perceived in a similar way as user-generated content. The implications for marketing managers concerning content marketing strategies are discussed.},

However, in recent years, they have also started to consider the gaming world. While gaming offers a potential revenue stream from sales of physical and digital clothing, change in it is also the gateway to access new opportunities of the so-called metaverse. Moreover, the development of mixed realities might, in a sense, ``democratize'' the industry by offering at a lower price the digital version of products that attract customers. Through an analysis of secondary data and the study of three cases, this research aims to understand how fashion companies adopt and adapt digital games to develop their communication and marketing strategies, and how gaming companies exploit fashion to develop their products. The main goal is to analyze from an academic perspective how the gaming industry represents a communication and marketing channel in which creative companies can produce immersive experiences different from those available through other means. Finally, this article provides a map of the relationships between fashion and gaming by proposing three categories: gamification in fashion, fashion games and fashion in games.},

This hesitation is attributed to five paradoxical motivational drivers and barriers: (1) sense of belonging: affiliation and non-affiliation; (2) pursuit of prestige and fame: enjoyment of disclosure and fear of privacy; (3) self-realization: proactive and forced self-realization; (4) freedom: full autonomy and restrained expectations; and (5) financial success: high payoffs today and uncertain payoffs tomorrow.},

To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale simulation study (N~=~11,398) and analyze the data using both the original limited-information method (PLS-SEM) and a full-information method (Lavaan SEM-ML). The results reveal a stark contrast: while PLS-SEM supports the original findings, the more stringent full-information SEM challenges them, finding minimal or non-significant relationships. This study contributes by demonstrating the critical impact of methodological choice in social media research and cautions against over-reliance on variance-based SEM for complex theoretical models. It offers practical implications for both marketers and academic researchers by highlighting the divergent findings and underscoring the need for methodological rigor when examining the link between social media activities and brand loyalty.},

  abstract = {Online marketplaces are rapidly shifting the trajectory of the e-commerce landscape. Brand manufacturers are starkly more dependent on online marketplaces, and for most brands, marketplace presence is not optional but mandatory. At this point, brand executives face a pivotal question in addressing their marketplace presence: What product selling (or distribution) approach should be adopted to leverage this channel for their brand? At its core, there are effectively two options offered to brand executives: selling to the online marketplace (as a 1p vendor); and selling on the marketplace platform (as a 3p seller). Whereas the conventional 1p vendor model is quintessentially the entry point to an online marketplace, some brand manufacturers migrate to the 3p seller model. Many others, however, avoid pulling the 3p trigger. In this paper, we address these two options a brand manufacturer has for selling (or allowing sales of) his product on a marketplace. On the grounds that online marketplaces retain brands at distinct price/quality tiers so as to be both comprehensive and robust, we propose a model of competition between two brand manufacturers whose products (in a category) are vertically differentiated on a quality/performance attribute and a convex marginal production cost is incurred for providing the higher quality. Given there is no single selling strategy on a marketplace that is ideal for all brand manufacturers and strategies would work the best under different market and competitive conditions, we investigate the impact of where a brand stands (vis-\'a-vis his competitor) on the two dimensions of a product-attribute space on the transitions of 1p brands to 3p sellers on the marketplace platform. We also extend the analysis to the setting where an online retailer decides on whether or not to add a marketplace platform to her existing online marketplace and (if so) on the referral fee percentage at which the product category would be listed.},
