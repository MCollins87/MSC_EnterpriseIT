\section{Introduction}

Nugget \& Co. are an online jewellery company, selling solid gold and silver at plated and Vermeil prices, a luxury product aimed at the affordable fashion market. Nugget \& Co. have implemented two key Points of Sale (POS): Online eCommerce and ``Jewellery Parties''. Nugget \& Co. are based in the Portsmouth region of England, and therefore these parties are limited to the South of England. 

In the years following COVID, physical shop presence on the high street has been in decline, mostly due to Brexit uncertainty and rising business rates \citep{marroncelli2022}. At the same time, Social Media users have doubled their time interacting with brands online \citep{blanco-moreno2023}, with under 40's making up most of this market. 

Young working age women are the primary target market of Nugget \& Co. as they have an increased familiarity and preference to shop online and are more likely to purchase demi-fine jewellery for themselves \citep{james2025}. 

This Literature Review will look at digital marketing strategies in the literature, considering changing purchasing habits and identify key areas of digital investment to maximise ROI, through driving online purchasing and advertising Jewellery Parties. 

\section{Research Question}

What Digital Marketing Strategies can Nugget \& Co implement to maximise ROI, given changing purchasing habits following COVID?

\section{Method}

An Iterative Literature Review was conducted, as outlined in Chapter 5 of \cite{dawson2015}, using Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and IEEEXplore using terms ``Digital Marketing'', ``Jewellery'', ``Millennial''. These results provided additional keywords for subsequant searches. 

The first round provided some exclusion criteria. A significant number of papers published in the area of demi-fine jewellery, and online marketing, originated from eastern Asia. \cite{kurien2021} discuss the Indian cultural influences towards jewellery purchasing, which differ to the UK and Western market. For research focusing on purchase intention and cultural drivers, European or North American research was preferred, however no exclusions were applied for technical implementation.

\section{Review of Previous Research}

Part of the ``first round'' of searching and reading focused on previous literature reviews on similar subjects. Jewellery itself showed up very little in the literature, most likely due to the reluctance of the jewellery market to implement online POS. The Jewellery industry utilise the theory that a luxury product demands exclusivity to drive higher prices \citep{holmqvist2020}. This resulted in the term ``luxury'' being included in search terminology as a proxy to jewellery, and inferences drawn from the luxury market and applied to the jewellery market. 

\cite{tam2025} conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) into digital marketing strategies for luxury brands, using Luis Vuitton, Gucci, and Channel as case studies. These brands are already well-established and utilise digital marketing to increase their brand presence, driving customers to physical locations for the retail experience. 

From their review, \cite{tam2025} identify six categories that digital marketing strategies can be grouped: One-way and Two-way communication with high, medium and low company control. Into these six categories, they identified 15 unique marketing strategies:

\hline \hline
High Company Control & Content Marketing; Story-telling Marketing & Email Marketing; Mobile Marketing; AI Chat Bot; Augmented Reality \\
\hline
Medium Company Control & Search Engine Marketing; Programmatic Marketing & Influencer Marketing \\
\hline
Low Company Control & Search Engine Optimisation & Social Media Marketing; Digital Runway; Digital Games \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Six categories of digital marketing, derived from \cite{tam2025}}
\label{table:1}
\end{table}


\cite{pinca2024} identify the following Digital Marketing Strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Social Media Marketing
\item Webinar Platforms
\item Mobile Applications and eCommerce
\item Content Marketing
\item Affiliate Marketing
\item Email Marketing
\end{enumerate}

There is some overlap in the 15 approaches identified in \cite{tam2025} and the six identified by \cite{pinca2024}. The approach by \cite{tam2025} is an interesting one, where they classify the digital strategies into high and low levels of control, which can be important to a luxury brand due to their desire to control exclusivity \citep{holmqvist2020}. 

Finally, \cite{spilotro2025}, identify the following Digital Marketing Strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use of Social Media as an advertising tool.
\item Digital channels for brand awareness.
\item Digitisation for internationalisation.
\item Digital Technologies as enablers of the eCommerce phenomenon.
\end{enumerate}

From these reviews, digital marketing can be summarised as two main activities: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Making oneself visible to the target market.}
\item \textbf{Converting that visibility to sales.}
\end{enumerate}

An effective Digital Marketing Strategy will be able to cover both elements simultaneously.

\section{Target Market}

It is estimated that 2025 will see 50\% of the luxury market will consist of 18-34 year-olds \citep{milanesi2023}. In 2023, online sales accounted for 16.7\% of all jewellery sales, compared to 8.1\% in 2021 \citep{classywomancollection2024}. This demographic accounts for most social media users at 59\% of all users being aged 18 to 34 \citep{larson2025}, and they show a strong preference to ethical and environmental issues \citep{djafarova2022}.  

These factors work to the advantage of Nugget \& Co., as Unique Selling Points include ``ethically sourced'', ``solid gold'' at ``affordable prices'', which the UK Gen Z market look for in products \citep{djafarova2022}.

Following COVID, these already tech literate buyers embraced the move to online, doubling luxury purchases from 12\% in 2019 to 23\% in 2020 \citep{milanesi2023}. 

\section{Increasing Visibility}
\subsection{Search Engine Optimisation}

The traditional method of increasing visibility is through Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), which is an essential tool for any company with an online presence. Appearing higher in search engine rankings naturally increases organic traffic to eCommerce platforms leading to potential sales \citep{almukhtar2021}, with only 0.6\% of users clicking on results from the second page of Google \citep{sezercirakoglu2024}.

SEO has evolved from simple key meta tags, and additional factors influence page ranking in an effort to reduce keyword manipulation \citep{tatikonda2024} ind improve the quality of content returned \citep{almukhtar2021}. Search engines now employ Generative AI techniques to optimise the results returned, for example Google ``RankBrain'' \citep{tatikonda2024}, although the usual caveats apply to trusting AI \citep{ashraf2024}. 

Following the roll-out of Google's ``Helpful Content'', many websites saw traffic drop. The algorithm aims to reward high-quality, user focused content, rather than content tailored solely for search engines \citep{sezercirakoglu2024}. Although this drop in traffic may be due to there no longer being a need to visit the website to obtain the required information. The phrase ``quality content'' however can be interpreted in many ways. \cite{sezercirakoglu2024} have considered using linguistic maxims in website content design to improve search rankings.  

Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM's) are only the latest in the tools implemented by Search Engines to aid users find the most relevant content. ``Traditional'' methods are still employed, such as informative ``alt-text'', and descriptive file names for other media (photos, videos etc.) \citep{roumeliotis2022}. 

Using key words in the content and meta-tags of the website itself can help with organic traffic, and search engines offer sponsored results, where keywords can be bought with either an auction or pay-per click model \citep{erdmann2022}. This is commonly referred to as Search Engine Marketing (SEM) \citep{erdmann2022, tam2025}. 

Another way SME's can use Search Engine tools, is with ``Google My Business'', a free tool that companies can use to manage their online presence \citep{roumeliotis2022}. When searching for services using Google, companies using Google My Business with physical locations set, Google will return results that are geographically closer to the user. 

\subsection{Social Media as a Digital Marketing Platform}

Research by Priori Data \citep{larson2025} suggest there are approximately 5.2 billion active social media users, accounting for around 64\% of the global population, with the average user spending almost two and a half hours daily in various social media platforms \citep{larson2025, westland2026}, making this the modern method of reaching any target audience. 

Social Media Content marketing allows for novel content to be created and presented directly to the target audience, through electronic word of mouth (eWOM) \citep{amed2019} for organic growth, or targeted advertising to selective audiences \citep{collier2022}. Social Media is particularly useful for SME's, as a cheap and flexible platform to begin advertising on, given the focus around user generated content \citep{eid2019, muller2019}. 

The major drawback to Social Media Marketing is that Social Media has low company control, which historically luxury brands resisted \citep{holmqvist2020, tam2025}. However, partnering with influencers with an established following provides authenticity and improves trust in the product \citep{sporl-wang2025}. 


\section{Converting visibility to sales}

One of the major challenges facing Nugget \& Co. is a lack of familiarity and trust in the quality of the product \citep{james2025}. The trust barrier is overcome by having a strong social media campaign with a platform building brand image, through partnering with Social Media Influencers \citep{sporl-wang2025}, for the new ``celebrity endorsement'' \citep{chan2022}. There is a strong correlation between social media interactions and purchasing intention \citep{deepika2025, sporl-wang2025, westland2026}. 

While Social Media Marketing may at first appear to  increase visibility and improve trust, this can be undermined by AI generated influencers, and these Human Like Influencers are more believable as humans \citep{kim2024a, miskolczi2026, montag2025}. Therefore, additional methods of sale conversion are needed. 

Gamification is the use of game-like activities in non-game contexts to market a product and increase brand awareness \citep{zichermann2010}. Gamification within luxury industries increases customer interaction and engagement \citep{milanesi2023}. While recent research into gamification and the digital luxury retail market has been focused on development of computer games \citep{milanesi2023, noris2023}, this does not mean this is the only way to use gamification in the jewellery sector. Simply put, gamification involves the customer engaging in an action, evoking a sense of tension and/or joy, that is ``different'' from normal life \citep{landers2018, noris2023}. Simple intensives to purchase such as, an additional gift, or entry into a prize draw, is considered gamification. 


\section{Omnichannel Selling}

Omnichannel Selling is an extension and evolution of multichannel selling. Where Multichannel selling involves selling products in multiple ways (eCommerce, Physical POS, Social Media etc.), Omnichannel takes this a step further by integrating and synchronising across these channels \citep{mou2024}. Studies have shown that consumers exposed to synchronised messaging across at least three different channels were significantly more likely to convert to sales, with results ranging from 12\% to 38\% depending on the study \citep{mou2024}. 

The journey to omnichannel selling faces significant challenges though, particularly for SME's \citep{febriani2025}. These small companies and start-ups are limited in their resources, managerial commitment and technological adaptability.  Although an easy way for a SME to begin multichannel selling it to use social media ``shops'' \citep{azadmoghddam2024}

\section{Discussion and Marketing Plan}
Nugget \& Co. have marketed themselves as \textit{Ethically Sourced, Solid Gold at Affordable Prices}. These are all attributes that today's 18 to 34 year-olds are looking for in products \citep{djafarova2022}. These contribute the majority of customers of the luxury fashion industry, and any company aiming to sell to 18 - 40 year-olds, needs to have a strong online presence \citep{munsch2021}. A strong Digital Marketing Strategy combine SEO, social media partnerships and gamification.

Social Media is likely to be the most effective platform for Nugget \& Co. to advertise  on, since the target market for Nugget \& Co. account for the majority of Social Media users. Paid advertising will allow content advertising products to achieve maximum, targeted reach, while partnering with established Social Media influencers to build trust in the product \citep{chan2022}. 

While SEO and Social Media Influencer marketing will draw customers in and increase the likelihood of these interactions converting to sales, Gamification tactics can also be used. All purchases  made through the eCommerce platform allow for order ID's to automatically enter a raffle-type draw, providing further incentive to make the purchase. 

To improve their digital marketing strategy, the following is recommended for Nugget \& Co.:
