# Wiki Post on Questionnaires

## Brief
Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.

Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?

Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.

## Wiki Post
The 2025 NHS Staff Survey (NSS) (NHS, 2025) is designed to capture staff experiences across jobs, teams, management, health, and career development. Its structured sections and emphasis on anonymity help staff provide honest feedback, and the use of multiple-choice and Likert-scale questions (Likert, 1932) makes analysis straightforward.

However, the survey is long, sometimes repetitive, and uses mixed scales, which can confuse respondents or lead to fatigue. Many questions are positively framed, risking response bias, and sensitive topics like harassment, discrimination, or workplace violence may be under-reported without clear support links.

To improve the NSS, the survey could be streamlined, with standardised scales and balanced question wording. Online adaptive formats could guide responses, and optional text fields would let staff explain answers in context. Enhancing inclusivity in demographics and linking sensitive questions to support resources would also encourage honesty.

With these tweaks, the NSS could better capture staff experiences and drive meaningful change across the NHS.
