# Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

## Brief
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media. 

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

## Reflection

The Cambridge Analytica scandal remains one of the most prominent examples of the misuse of online surveys for large-scale data extraction and behavioural manipulation. In 2018, investigative reporting revealed that the company had harvested data from tens of millions of Facebook users via the seemingly benign personality quiz _“This Is Your Digital Life.”_ Although only around 270,000 users completed the quiz, Facebook’s pre-2015 API allowed the app to access extensive information from participants and their Facebook friends, resulting in the unlawful acquisition of an estimated 50–87 million profiles (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018; Confessore, 2018). These data were subsequently used to construct psychographic models and micro-target political messaging during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit campaign. This case revealed how surveys framed as harmless entertainment or academic research can mask intrusive political or commercial objectives, violating core ethical principles of informed consent, transparency, and respect for autonomy.

Despite widespread public scrutiny and regulatory reforms following the scandal, similar practices continue across digital platforms. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC, 2023)  has warned that online quizzes and social-media questionnaires remain a common mechanism for collecting personal information, often capturing details—such as birthplace, favourite items, or pet names—that map directly onto security-verification questions or can be aggregated for targeted advertising. Security analysts similarly report that such quizzes often act as a funnel for behavioural and biographical data later resold by data brokers (Bizga, 2024). Although major platforms such as Facebook banned personality-quiz apps after 2019, thousands of independent websites and mobile apps continue to operate with minimal oversight, meaning the underlying risks persist.

Misuse of surveys also extends into organisational settings. Customer-satisfaction or employee-feedback surveys may be repurposed as covert monitoring tools, with researchers noting that opaque data-collection practices undermine trust, autonomy, and fairness in the workplace (Ball, 2010). In such contexts, surveys function not as instruments for improvement but as mechanisms of surveillance.

These examples raise significant ethical, social, legal, and professional concerns. Ethically, they violate principles of informed consent and transparency; socially, they contribute to distrust of digital services and the normalisation of surveillance; legally, they conflict with data-protection regimes such as the UK/EU GDPR, particularly regarding purpose limitation and lawful processing (ICO, 2018). From a professional standpoint, data practitioners have obligations—reflected in codes such as the ACM (2018) and BCS (2021) — to ensure integrity, accountability, and responsible stewardship of personal data. Collectively, these cases demonstrate the continued need for stronger governance, clearer consent processes, and sustained ethical oversight in the design and deployment of digital surveys.
