## Initial Post

The Medical Implant case (ACM, no date) covers many legal, social and professional issues. It is not clear in the study what formal steps were taken following the assessment that the risk is negligible, however up to the point of making that determination, Corazón have acted in a manner upholding both ACM (ACM, 2018) and BCS (BCS, 2021) ethical codes of practice.

By using recognised cryptographic methods, and welcoming external scrutiny through a bug-bounty, Corazón have shown commitment to quality, transparency and continuous improvement. All key expectations of both ACM and BCS. The willingness to collaborate with the researcher rather than conceal the flaw, shows ethical maturity and accountability.

Legally and socially, the Corazón's actions demonstrate due diligence and respect for patient safety, supporting compliance with data protection and Medical Device governance. Professionally, their engagement fosters public trust and models responsible disclosure practices.

What is not clear from the case study, is the actions of Corazón after establishing the risk is negligible. A negligible risk, resulting from a hard-coded vulnerability, is still a risk that must be addressed, particularly within Medical Devices. UK regulations provide a mechanism for reporting vulnerabilities and issues with Medical Devices through the MHRA Yellow Card scheme (Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, no date). Additionally, as a manufacturer of healthcare software, Corazón are able to add this as a known risk to their Clinical Safety File, as defined by DCB0129 (NHS England, 2018a). This provides details of the risk to the healthcare organisation, allowing them to assess the risk and impact to their patients through DCB0160 (NHS England, 2018b).

Failure to report would go against the principles of transparency, so even though the risk is assessed to be negligible, the ACM and BCS codes both require open and honest reporting to customers and regulatory bodies.
