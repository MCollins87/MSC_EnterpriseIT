# The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

## Scientific Method

Two core types of reasoning are introduced: **Deductive** and **Inductive** Reasoning.

- **Deductive Reasoning**
	- Idea -> Observation -> Conclusion
- **Inductive Reasoning**
	- Observation -> Analysis -> Theory

## Ethics in Computing
Two formative activities cover the subject of Ethics in computing. 

1. [Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI](./EthicsAndAI.md)
2. [Collaborative Discussion - Case Study](./ColabDiscussion_Initial.md)
