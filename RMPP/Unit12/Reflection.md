# Reflection

## Course Overview
The module Research Methods and Professional Practice covered a range of topics, aimed at guiding the student to develop a research topic, and provide the tools and skills needed to conduct the research.

Beginning with Unit 1, we were introduced to the Scientific Method and ethics in computing. My Bachelors degree was a highly scientific degree in Physics, so covering deductive and inductive reasoning was more revision than anything else. The discussion on ethics however was more interesting, and encouraged me to apply these scientific and analytical skills to ethical considerations.

My career so far has been within the highly regulated field of healthcare, where many professionals are registered with professional bodies. My experience of being registered with the Register of Clinical Technologists, and their own code of practice (The Register of Clinical Technologists, 2025), compares with the BCS (BCS, 2021) and ACM (ACM, 2018) codes locked at over the first three weeks. In short, ethics comes down to how ones actions (or lack of) impact others. We should aim for a positive impact, and avoid negative.

Many of the subsequent modules covered topics that related directly to the two Summative Assignments of this module - a literature review, and a research proposal presentation. Topics include:


- **Unit 2:** Research Questions, Literature Review and Research Proposal
- **Unit 3:** Methodology and Research Methods
- **Unit 4:** Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations
- **Unit 5:** Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design
- **Unit 6:** Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. 
- **Unit 7:** Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

The knowledge gained from these units are needed to begin a research project. One must know how to construct a research idea, and what data collection methods to use and which will provide the most value to answer the research question.

The remaining units cover how to use the data collected, and how to present the information:

- **Unit 8:**  Data Analysis and Visualisation
- **Unit 9:** Validity and Generalisability in Research
- **Unit 10:** Research Writing 

I found the data visualisation topics interesting, as this relates quite closely to my current employment. As manager of the Oncology Information System (OIS), I must routinely collect and present data from the OIS to inform research and Business Intelligence. I routinely create reports and dashboards in Power BI, and the Microsoft Lab exercise has provided me with ideas on how I can improve the design of the reports I produce and manage. In particular, the idea that the Fibonacci Sequence can be used to draw the readers attention to important information.

A previous employer once taught me that when producing a graph to present your work, make design decisions that will allow information to still be conveyed after the graph has been photocopied multiple times and resized. Photocopied hard copies are no longer the standard in which data is visualised, and the units in this module have led me to consider accessibility as part of report design.

## Assignments
The two assignments completed for this module allowed me to explore an area of research I wouldn't normally have the opportunity for. My employer is funding this course, so there is an expectation that my capstone project will directly benefit the service provided by the local Oncology service. After being instructed that the topic for the literature review and research proposal should not be that of our capstone project, I began considering research areas outside of my current employment.

Currently my wife is embarking on launching an eCommerce business. Using the learning outcomes from previous modules, this Masters program in Enterprise IT Management has allowed me to support her practically and technically, rather than just emotionally. I therefore settled on digital marketing for the industry my wife is entering.

Not only did these assignments teach me the importance of the literature review process when beginning a research project, but also provided the insight into an area of Enterprise IT that I had not previously been exposed to. I learnt a significant amount regarding digital marketing methods and technologies, identifying gaps and relating them to a specific issue - omnichannel marketing for SME's.

## Challenges
During this module I faced some significant disruption in my personal life. My wife was admitted to hospital with acute appendicitis, requiring emergency surgery on Christmas day. This, combined with a six-year-old son meant that some activities relating to this module were neglected. I managed to catch-up, and the only activity I was unable to complete was the second collaborative discussion, as this required timely interaction with my peers, that I was unable to commit to.

It is hard to say for certain, but I would also speculate that some of the feedback I received for Assignment 2 (Research Proposal presentation), can be directly attributed to the amount of attention I paid to completing the assignment. Were it not for the my family situation, I would have probably spent more time on the presentation format, and considered how the slides were viewed.

Family life has been a constant challenge throughout the course. Despite my employer funding the course, they are unable to provide me with any protected time during the working week to complete the required activities. With the final capstone project aligning with my employers objectives, this should change, allowing me to allocate time and resources during the working week to complete the research project.

## Conclusions and the future
In summary, this module has provided revision on research methods and the scientific principle, as well as providing new insights and perspectives on ethics in computing, given how quickly technology advances, frameworks to protect the public may not be able to keep up with the constant change.

Topics on data visualisation and presenting information have been particularly useful. Although I do this daily, this module has provided fresh perspective, which I will be able to implement in my everyday processing of data and information.
