# Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

In Week 7 where we will continue to explore quantitative methods and focus more specifically on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. In a nutshell, ‘The goal of inferential statistics is to discover some property or general pattern about a large group by studying a smaller group of people in the hopes that the results will generalize to the larger group.’ (Purdue U, 2023).

The reason is called inference is because as we are making inferences about a population from a sample of data. Inference is the process of extracting meaningful and useful business information from raw data. This process is known as **statistical inference**, because it involves using the data to make valid inferences about the underlying population. As data is inherently variable, all such inferences will necessarily be subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty is quantified using probability.

Instead of estimating some population value of interest that underlies the data, an alternative form of inference is to use the data to provide evidence about whether some assumption of interest regarding that population value is likely to be true. Such a form of inference is known as **hypothesis testing** and is usually preferred to the estimation approach when interest lies in comparing the relevant values underlying two or more different populations.

These are all techniques we can employ to find patterns and meaning from our data.
