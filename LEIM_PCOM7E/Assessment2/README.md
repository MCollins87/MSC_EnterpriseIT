# Assessment 2: Individual Programming Excercise
## Brief
For this individual programming exercise you will be comparing programming languages. Your tutor will have already demonstrated a sort algorithm in two different languages during the seminar in Unit 4.

You are required to create a sort algorithm in Python that you can use to sort a provided set of integers. For this, you are provided with a simple python program that implements a basic sort algorithm. You must modify this program, replacing the provided algorithm with another of your choice.

In addition to the sort algorithm, you are also provided with a text file, called pidata.txt, that contains over a million individual integers, collected into sets. This is the file you need to process.

## Question
Compare and contrast your selected algorithm implemented in Python, the times from your application using the built-in sort of function (if applicable) with the one demonstrated in class written in a compiled language. Which performs the best? Give reasons for your answer, supported by appropriate academic references.â€¯

You should provide a text file that includes all references (presented in the Essex format), plus your discussion of algorithms. This file should be professionally formatted and proofread.
