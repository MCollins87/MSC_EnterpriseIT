# Assessment 3: Individual Presentaion
## Brief
You are tasked with developing a PowerPoint presentation (of up to 10 slides) that reflects on future technology/techniques and learning styles. In addition to your PowerPoint, you should also create a recording of your individual reflection (20 minutes in length) with a transcript.
## Question
Consider the statement *“Enterprise IT encapsulates ALL the technology trends that will make the greatest impact on Industry in the next five years”*. Identify ONE trend that you feel will have the greatest impact over the next five years.

In describing your chosen trend, you should also explain why you think it will have the most impact and how you think it will impact industry and working life. Your slides should have a strong reflective bias focus with critical insights, considering the effects as opposed to the technical aspects of your chosen trend.

For the reflective aspect, consider:

- How did working on the assessments make you feel? 
- How did these emotions affect you and your everyday work? 
- Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done?
- Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this module.
