# Launching into Enterprise IT Management April 2024

## Assessment 1: Collaberative Learning Question
### Brief
You are tasked with selecting a company/SME that you are familiar with. Identify the main EIT design component that has influenced the development of the business. Was it a positive or negative impact? What if anything would you do differently than the company’s original action?

If you are not currently working in industry, then select a company/SME that is the subject of a case study – periodicals, such as Computer Weekly, often provide case studies of companies as do the IEEE.

After the tutor has opened the discussion with a post, students are required to offer an **initial** post that demonstrates their answer to the question (in Unit 1), then read and respond to two of their peers' initial posts, making comments and asking questions (in Unit 2), and provide a summary of the discussion, based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers (in Unit 3), **always using an academic tone and backing up your ideas using appropriate citations and references.**

From those posts, animation and leadership, application to the real world, and reflection will be assessed. The initial post should be labelled **'Initial Post'**, the two follow-up responses should be labelled as **'Peer Response 1'** and **'Peer Response 2'** and the summary post labelled as **'Summary Post'**. The initial post, two responses and summary will be judged according to all grading criteria.

## [Assessment 2: Individual Programming Excercise](LEIM_PCOM7E/Assessment2)
### Brief
For this individual programming exercise you will be comparing programming languages. Your tutor will have already demonstrated a sort algorithm in two different languages during the seminar in Unit 4.

You are required to create a sort algorithm in Python that you can use to sort a provided set of integers. For this, you are provided with a simple python program that implements a basic sort algorithm. You must modify this program, replacing the provided algorithm with another of your choice.

In addition to the sort algorithm, you are also provided with a text file, called pidata.txt, that contains over a million individual integers, collected into sets. This is the file you need to process.

## [Assessment 3: Individual Presentaion](LEIM_PCOM7E/Assessment3)
### Brief
You are tasked with developing a PowerPoint presentation (of up to 10 slides) that reflects on future technology/techniques and learning styles. In addition to your PowerPoint, you should also create a recording of your individual reflection (20 minutes in length) with a transcript.
### Question
Consider the statement *“Enterprise IT encapsulates ALL the technology trends that will make the greatest impact on Industry in the next five years”*. Identify ONE trend that you feel will have the greatest impact over the next five years.

In describing your chosen trend, you should also explain why you think it will have the most impact and how you think it will impact industry and working life. Your slides should have a strong reflective bias focus with critical insights, considering the effects as opposed to the technical aspects of your chosen trend.

For the reflective aspect, consider:

- How did working on the assessments make you feel? 
- How did these emotions affect you and your everyday work? 
- Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done?
- Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this module.
